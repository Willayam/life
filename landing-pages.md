# Landing Pages That Don't Suck

Source: Alex Hormozi

## 1. Headline

Stop them in their tracks. Promise a clear outcome. Nothing else.

## 2. Sub-headline

Clarifies the promise. Adds context to the headline the way a YouTube thumbnail adds context to a title.

## 3. Hero Image

Adds proof to the headline and sub-headline. Show either:
- The thing they're going to get, or
- The outcome they want to experience, visually

## 4. CTA

Two things only: what they're going to get and how they're going to get it.

## 5. Form

As few fields as needed for a qualified lead — but that might still be 4-5 fields. Optimize for customers, not opt-ins. If more than 5 fields, break into multiple steps.

## 6. One-line Description (optional)

Answers: "Why should I give my email?" Pure justification for the lead magnet.

## 7. Bullets Below the Fold

Three bullets max. Each one addresses a top objection, ordered most common to least common.

## 8. Social Proof

Only add if needed or if the offer is more complex. Place it underneath everything else.

## 9. Visual Design

Keep it blank. Direct all attention toward the single action you want them to take.

## 10. Technical / Final Details

- Keep it short — longer pages convert lower
- Mobile-optimized
- Fast load times — compress all images
- Legal stuff at the bottom so you don't get in trouble

## The Razor

If it doesn't increase the opt-in percentage of qualified leads, cut it.
