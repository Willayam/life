## Upcoming: Vasaloppet

- **When:** ~Late Feb / Early Mar 2026
- **Status:** Low training volume, decent base fitness
- **Partner:** Friend in worse shape - this is about finishing, not competing
- **Plan:** Just enjoy it. Don't get injured. Use it as motivation to keep training after.

### Race Day Fuel: Homemade Protein Bars (~94 cents/bar)

**Base layer:**
- Oatmeal
- Protein powder
- Peanut butter powder
- Cocoa powder
- Greek yogurt
- Almond milk

Mix dry ingredients, add yogurt and almond milk until you get a dough. Press into a tin.

**Topping:**
- Dark chocolate (melted)
- Coconut oil

Melt chocolate with coconut oil, pour over base layer. Fridge until set, slice into 5 bars.

- [ ] Make a batch of these before Vasaloppet

## Nutrition

Tracking calories in MacroFactor consistently for years. This is a strength - keep it going.

**Current approach:**
- Log everything in MacroFactor
- Export data periodically for analysis here

**To lose 3 kg (83 → 80):**
- Modest deficit of ~300-500 cal/day
- Prioritize protein for satiety and muscle retention
- Timeline: 6-10 weeks at healthy pace

### Recent Food Log
See [food-log.md](../food-log.md) for daily tracking.

## Sleep

**Current state:** Really up and down. This is a major lever.

**Note:** Frida is a PhD sleep researcher. Leverage her expertise!

### Sleep Improvement Action Items
- [ ] Establish consistent wake time: **7:00** (6:30 on Charlie days) — non-negotiable
- [ ] Phone charges outside bedroom — eliminates morning scroll and late-night doom
- [ ] Screens off by **22:30** — evening routine starts at 22:15 (see [[routines]])
- [ ] Caffeine cutoff: **14:00** — no coffee, tea, or energy drinks after this
- [ ] Bedroom temp: 18-19°C — cooler = better deep sleep
- [ ] Track sleep data (which app/device?)
- [ ] Identify patterns: What makes a good night vs bad night?
- [ ] Ask Frida for her top 3 evidence-based sleep tips (she's literally a PhD sleep researcher — use this advantage)
- [ ] Target: lights out **23:00**, wake **7:00** = 8h opportunity, ~7-7.5h actual sleep

## Training

### Current
- Minimal structured training
- Vasaloppet prep (some skiing/cardio)

### Target Routine (Post-Vasaloppet)
- [ ] Define 3-4x/week training plan
- [ ] Mix of: strength training, cardio (biking to preschool?), skiing/outdoor
- [ ] The e-bike preschool commute could be built-in daily exercise
- [ ] Morning routine includes 20 pushups/stretch — not a workout, but daily movement baseline
- [ ] See [[routines]] for how training blocks fit into the daily schedule

### The E-Bike Opportunity
- Preschool run: 45 min each way currently
- E-bike could cut to ~20 min each way AND provide daily exercise
- Company can potentially lease it (tax advantage)
- **Action:** Research e-bike lease options through company

## Data Import TODO
- [ ] Export MacroFactor data and create summary analysis
- [ ] Set up weight tracking log here
- [ ] Identify sleep tracking method and start logging
- [ ] Post-Vasaloppet: define structured training plan
