# Health & Energy Dashboard

## Result
80 kg lean. Consistent training. Great sleep. High daily energy. Strong, flexible, skilled, powerful body for decades.

## Purpose
Everything depends on energy. If I'm tired, sluggish, or sick, nothing else works. Health is the foundation that makes the ambitious life possible. Charlie and Baby #2 are watching — the way I treat my body is the blueprint they'll follow.

## Mindset
**[The Mindset System](mindset.md)** — Identity-level rewiring. Not discipline. Not motivation. *Becoming someone who loves the process.* The effort is the craft.

## Upcoming: Vasaloppet

- **When:** ~Late Feb / Early Mar 2026
- **Status:** Low training volume, decent base fitness
- **Partner:** Friend in worse shape - this is about finishing, not competing
- **Plan:** Just enjoy it. Don't get injured. Use it as motivation to keep training after.

### Race Day Fuel: Homemade Protein Bars (~94 cents/bar)

## Nutrition

Tracking calories in MacroFactor consistently for years. This is a strength - keep it going.

**Current approach:**
- Log everything in MacroFactor
- Export data periodically for analysis here

**To lose 3 kg (83 → 80):**
- Modest deficit of ~300-500 cal/day
- Prioritize protein for satiety and muscle retention
- Timeline: 6-10 weeks at healthy pace

### Recent Food Log
See [food-log.md](../food-log.md) for daily tracking.

## Sleep

**Current state:** Really up and down. This is a major lever.

**Note:** Frida is a PhD sleep researcher. Leverage her expertise!

### Sleep Improvement Action Items
- [ ] Establish consistent wake time (7:30 is good - make it non-negotiable)
- [ ] Track sleep data (which app/device?)
- [ ] Identify patterns: What makes a good night vs bad night?
- [ ] Evening routine: screens off time, wind-down ritual
- [ ] Ask Frida for her top 3 evidence-based sleep tips

## Training

### Current
- Minimal structured training
- Vasaloppet prep (some skiing/cardio)

### Target Routine
See **[Mindset System — Training Framework](mindset.md#training-framework)** for the full 5x/week plan: upper/lower split + skills day + conditioning + active recovery.

**Skill goals:** Handstand hold, muscle-up, pistol squat, L-sit, deep squat, bridge push-up. See [mindset.md#skills-to-develop](mindset.md#skills-to-develop).

- [ ] Mix of: strength training, cardio (biking to preschool?), skiing/outdoor
- [ ] The e-bike preschool commute could be built-in daily exercise

### The E-Bike Opportunity
- Preschool run: 45 min each way currently
- E-bike could cut to ~20 min each way AND provide daily exercise
- Company can potentially lease it (tax advantage)
- **Action:** Research e-bike lease options through company

## Data Import TODO
- [ ] Export MacroFactor data and create summary analysis
- [ ] Set up weight tracking log here
- [ ] Identify sleep tracking method and start logging
- [ ] Post-Vasaloppet: define structured training plan
