# Health & Energy Dashboard

## Result
A body that feels powerful, resilient, and energized every day. Strong enough to play rough with Charlie for decades. High stamina. Low inflammation. No mystery allergies dragging me down. 80 kg lean.

## Purpose
Everything depends on energy. If I'm tired, inflamed, or reactive to random stuff, nothing else works - not Maxa, not family, not any of it. Health is the multiplier on everything. A strong, low-inflammation body means sharper thinking, better mood, more patience with Charlie, more presence with Frida, and the stamina to build what I want to build.

## The Three Pillars

### Pillar 1: Reduce Inflammation & Identify Allergies

Yes, this is a real thing to worry about. Chronic low-grade inflammation is linked to fatigue, brain fog, poor recovery, increased allergic sensitivity, and basically feeling like crap. The good news: it's very addressable through diet, sleep, and lifestyle.

**Why you might be feeling more reactive:**
- Poor or inconsistent sleep drives up inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP) - Frida can confirm this from her research
- Stress (financial pressure, multiple projects, baby coming) elevates cortisol which increases inflammation
- Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common in Stockholm, especially winter - low D correlates with increased allergic sensitivity and inflammation
- Gut health: if gut barrier is compromised ("leaky gut"), more food proteins enter the bloodstream and trigger immune responses - this can make you suddenly seem allergic to things you used to tolerate
- Diet quality matters beyond just calories and macros

**Action Plan - Inflammation:**

- [ ] **Get bloodwork done** - Request: CRP (inflammation), Vitamin D, ferritin (iron stores), thyroid panel (TSH, T3, T4), full blood count. This gives a real baseline instead of guessing. Book through Werlabs or your vårdcentral.
- [ ] **Start Vitamin D3 supplementation** - 2000-4000 IU/day through at least April. Almost everyone in Stockholm is deficient in winter. Take with fat (meal) for absorption. This alone can reduce allergic reactivity.
- [ ] **Add Omega-3s** - 2-3g EPA+DHA daily (fish oil or fatty fish 3x/week). Omega-3s directly compete with inflammatory omega-6 pathways. This is one of the most well-supported anti-inflammatory interventions.
- [ ] **Run a 2-week food awareness log** - In addition to MacroFactor (which tracks macros), note in food-log.md how you *feel* after meals. Energy, bloating, congestion, skin reactions, brain fog. Look for patterns. Common culprits: dairy, gluten, eggs, histamine-rich foods (aged cheese, wine, fermented foods).
- [ ] **Reduce high-inflammation foods** - Cut back on: refined sugar, excessive alcohol, processed/fried foods, seed oils where easy to swap. Not about being perfect, about shifting the baseline.
- [ ] **Add anti-inflammatory staples** - Work these into regular rotation: fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), berries, leafy greens, olive oil, ginger, turmeric (with black pepper for absorption), nuts, dark chocolate (>70%).
- [ ] **Ask Frida about sleep-inflammation connection** - She literally researches this. Get her take on your sleep patterns and inflammatory load.

### Pillar 2: Build Strength & Stamina

The goal isn't bodybuilder or marathon runner. It's a strong, capable, high-endurance body that recovers well and has energy left over at the end of the day.

**Training Plan: 4x/Week**

| Day | Focus | Duration | Example |
|-----|-------|----------|---------|
| Mon | Strength - Upper | 45-60 min | Bench/OHP, rows, pull-ups, accessories |
| Tue | Zone 2 Cardio | 30-45 min | E-bike commute, easy run, or ski |
| Thu | Strength - Lower | 45-60 min | Squat, deadlift, lunges, core |
| Sat | Active/Outdoor | 45-90 min | Skiing, long bike ride, hike with Charlie |

**Strength principles:**
- Compound movements first (squat, deadlift, bench, OHP, rows, pull-ups) - these build real-world strength and trigger the hormonal response you want
- Progressive overload - add weight or reps each week, even small amounts
- Don't skip legs - lower body training drives the biggest hormonal and metabolic response
- Keep it simple - a basic program done consistently beats a fancy program done sporadically

**Stamina/Cardio principles:**
- Zone 2 (conversational pace) for base endurance - this builds mitochondrial density which directly increases daily energy
- The e-bike commute counts as zone 2 if you keep it moderate
- One harder session per week (intervals, hill sprints, or intense ski) for cardiovascular fitness
- Don't overdo cardio while in a caloric deficit - it'll tank your energy and recovery

**Post-Vasaloppet transition:**
- [ ] Start the 4x/week structure the week after Vasaloppet
- [ ] Get access to a gym (which gym? Home equipment? Decide this)
- [ ] Start light - first 2 weeks at 60-70% effort to build the habit, then ramp up
- [ ] Track workouts (simple: exercise, sets, reps, weight - in a note or app)

### Pillar 3: Sleep & Recovery

This is the single biggest lever. No amount of training or diet fixes bad sleep. And sleep is directly linked to inflammation, allergies, energy, and strength gains.

**Note:** Frida is a PhD sleep researcher. This is an absurdly underutilized advantage.

**Sleep Protocol:**
- [ ] **Non-negotiable wake time: 7:30 AM** - Anchor the circadian rhythm. Even on weekends. Even when Charlie isn't there.
- [ ] **Screens off by 22:00** - Blue light suppresses melatonin. Use night shift/f.lux as a bridge, but ideally no screens last hour.
- [ ] **Bedroom: cold, dark, for sleep only** - 16-18°C, blackout curtains, no phone charging by the bed.
- [ ] **Morning light within 30 min of waking** - Go outside or at minimum stand by a window. This sets the circadian clock, especially critical in Swedish winter. Consider a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp for dark mornings.
- [ ] **Caffeine cutoff: 14:00** - Caffeine has a half-life of ~5 hours. Afternoon coffee is sabotaging sleep even if you don't feel it.
- [ ] **Ask Frida for her top 3 evidence-based tips** - Seriously, do this. She knows more about this than any article.

**Recovery beyond sleep:**
- Manage stress actively - the Maxa pressure, financial optimization, baby prep, custody logistics... this is a lot. Stress = cortisol = inflammation = poor recovery = less energy. The cycle is real.
- Walking is underrated recovery - a 15-20 min walk after meals improves blood sugar response and aids digestion
- Don't train hard on bad sleep nights - drop to a light session or zone 2 instead

## Nutrition (Updated)

Tracking calories in MacroFactor consistently for years. This is a strength - keep it going. But now expand beyond just macros to think about *food quality* and how food makes you feel.

**Current approach - keep:**
- Log everything in MacroFactor
- Modest deficit (~300-500 cal/day) for the 83→80 kg cut
- High protein (1.6-2.0 g/kg bodyweight = 130-165g/day) for satiety and muscle retention

**New additions:**
- Track how you feel after meals in [food-log.md](../food-log.md) (energy, bloating, congestion)
- Prioritize whole foods over processed when practical
- Anti-inflammatory foods in regular rotation (see Pillar 1)
- Eat enough - don't crash diet while trying to build strength. A modest deficit is fine. Aggressive restriction will kill energy, recovery, and your immune system.
- Stay hydrated - 2-3L water/day minimum. Dehydration drives fatigue and inflammation.

### Race Day Fuel: Homemade Protein Bars (~94 cents/bar)

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RSL-9dnOUyM)

**Base layer:**
- Oatmeal
- Protein powder
- Peanut butter powder
- Cocoa powder
- Greek yogurt
- Almond milk

Mix dry ingredients, add yogurt and almond milk until you get a dough. Press into a tin.

**Topping:**
- Dark chocolate (melted)
- Coconut oil

Melt chocolate with coconut oil, pour over base layer. Fridge until set, slice into 5 bars.

- [ ] Make a batch of these before Vasaloppet

## Supplements (Evidence-Based Only)

Keep this minimal. Most supplements are waste of money. These have strong evidence:

| Supplement | Dose | Why | Priority |
|-----------|------|-----|----------|
| Vitamin D3 | 2000-4000 IU/day | Deficiency almost guaranteed in Stockholm winter. Immune function, inflammation, mood. | **Do this now** |
| Omega-3 (EPA+DHA) | 2-3g/day | Anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular, brain function. | **Do this now** |
| Magnesium glycinate | 200-400mg before bed | Sleep quality, muscle recovery, most people are low. | Start after bloodwork |
| Creatine monohydrate | 5g/day | Strength, recovery, and increasingly studied for cognitive benefits. Cheapest effective supplement. | Start when training regularly |
| Probiotic | Quality multi-strain | Gut health → immune regulation → reduced allergic reactivity. | Consider after food log |

- [ ] Buy Vitamin D3 and Omega-3 this week
- [ ] Buy creatine and magnesium when training starts

## Upcoming: Vasaloppet

- **When:** ~Late Feb / Early Mar 2026
- **Status:** Low training volume, decent base fitness
- **Partner:** Friend in worse shape - this is about finishing, not competing
- **Plan:** Just enjoy it. Don't get injured. Use it as the catalyst to start the real training plan after.

## The E-Bike Opportunity

- Preschool run: 45 min each way currently
- E-bike could cut to ~20 min each way AND provide daily zone 2 exercise
- Company can potentially lease it (tax advantage)
- This is a two-for-one: solve the commute problem AND get built-in daily cardio
- [ ] Research e-bike lease options through company

## Weekly Health Check-In

Questions to answer each week in the weekly review:
1. Average weight this week?
2. How was sleep quality (1-10)?
3. How many training sessions?
4. Energy level average (1-10)?
5. Any allergic reactions or inflammation symptoms this week?
6. What helped? What hurt?
7. Did I take my supplements consistently?
