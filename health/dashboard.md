## Upcoming: Vasaloppet

- **When:** ~Late Feb / Early Mar 2026
- **Status:** Low training volume, decent base fitness
- **Partner:** Friend in worse shape - this is about finishing, not competing
- **Plan:** Just enjoy it. Don't get injured. Use it as motivation to keep training after.

## Nutrition

Tracking calories in MacroFactor consistently for years. This is a strength - keep it going.

**Current approach:**
- Log everything in MacroFactor
- Export data periodically for analysis here

**To lose 3 kg (83 → 80):**
- Modest deficit of ~300-500 cal/day
- Prioritize protein for satiety and muscle retention
- Timeline: 6-10 weeks at healthy pace

## Training

### Current
- Minimal structured training
- Vasaloppet prep (some skiing/cardio)

### Target Routine (Post-Vasaloppet)
- [ ] Define 3-4x/week training plan
- [ ] Mix of: strength training, cardio (biking to preschool?), skiing/outdoor
- [ ] The e-bike preschool commute could be built-in daily exercise

### The E-Bike Opportunity
- Preschool run: 45 min each way currently
- E-bike could cut to ~20 min each way AND provide daily exercise
- Company can potentially lease it (tax advantage)
- **Action:** Research e-bike lease options through company
