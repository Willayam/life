# Health & Energy Dashboard

## Result
80 kg lean. Consistent training. Great sleep. High daily energy. Strong body for decades. Sharp mind every day.

## Purpose
Everything depends on energy. If I'm tired, sluggish, or sick, nothing else works. Health is the foundation that makes the ambitious life possible. Optimizing health = optimizing output, happiness, and presence with Charlie and Frida.

## The Five Pillars

### 1. Nutrition (MacroFactor)
- **Tracking:** MacroFactor daily — this is a strength, keep it going
- **Current approach:** Log everything, export periodically to [[food-log]]
- **Cut protocol:** 300-500 cal deficit, prioritize protein (1.6-2.2g/kg = 130-180g/day)
- **Key focus areas:**
  - Micronutrient density — not just macros. Prioritize whole foods
  - Meal timing around training
  - Hydration (target 3L/day minimum)

### 2. Sleep
- **Current state:** Inconsistent. This is the #1 lever for energy and mental clarity.
- **Expert resource:** Frida (PhD sleep researcher) — leverage her expertise
- **Targets:**
  - Consistent wake time: 07:00 (non-negotiable)
  - Bedtime window: 22:30-23:00
  - Total sleep: 7-8 hours
  - Sleep quality score: 85%+
- **Tracking method:** TBD — need device or app
- **Action items:**
  - [ ] Choose sleep tracking method (Oura, Apple Watch, or app)
  - [ ] Establish non-negotiable wake time
  - [ ] Create evening wind-down protocol
  - [ ] Ask Frida for her top 3 evidence-based sleep interventions

### 3. Training
- **Current:** Minimal structured training. Vasaloppet base fitness.
- **Target:** 4x/week structured training
- **Training split (draft):**
  - 2x strength (full body or upper/lower)
  - 1x cardio/zone 2 (e-bike commute counts)
  - 1x flexibility/mobility (Functional Patterns?)
- **E-bike opportunity:** Preschool commute as built-in daily zone 2 cardio
- **Action items:**
  - [ ] Book initial session at KAN-kliniken for Functional Patterns assessment
  - [ ] Research e-bike lease options through company
  - [ ] Define concrete weekly training schedule
  - [ ] Start logging training sessions

### 4. Blood Work & Biomarkers
- **Purpose:** Identify deficiencies, optimize hormones, catch issues early
- **Tracking:** [[health/blood-work]] — full panel tracking with optimal ranges
- **Protocol:** Baseline blood panel → retest every 3-4 months
- **Action items:**
  - [ ] Book comprehensive blood panel (see blood-work.md for what to order)
  - [ ] Get baseline results and log them

### 5. Supplements & Recovery
- **Tracking:** [[health/supplements]]
- **Principle:** Supplement based on blood work data, not guessing
- **Minimum stack (before blood work):**
  - Vitamin D3 (2000-4000 IU/day) — Sweden = limited sun
  - Omega-3 (2g EPA+DHA/day)
  - Magnesium glycinate (200-400mg before bed — also helps sleep)
- **After blood work:** Adjust based on actual deficiencies

## Weight Log

Track weekly averages (weigh daily, log the weekly average).

| Week | Avg Weight | Trend | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| W09 (Feb 24) | — | — | Post-Vasaloppet, need to start |

---

## Weekly Health Metrics

Captured each week in [[planning/weekly/template]] and aggregated here for trends.

| Week | Weight | Sleep (1-10) | Training Sessions | Energy (1-10) | Clarity (1-10) | Mood (1-10) |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| W09 | — | — | — | — | — | — |

## Daily Tracking (What To Log)

Every day in your [[templates/daily]] note, capture:

1. **Sleep:** Hours slept + quality (1-10)
2. **Energy:** Overall energy level (1-10)
3. **Mental clarity:** Focus and cognitive sharpness (1-10)
4. **Mood:** General happiness/well-being (1-10)
5. **Training:** What you did (or rest day)
6. **Stress:** Level (1-10) — stress is a key confounder
7. **Notable factors:** Alcohol, poor food choices, late screen time, caffeine timing, etc.

This data lets me (Claude) spot patterns: "Your energy drops to 4 every time you sleep under 6 hours" or "Your clarity is consistently higher on training days."

## Coaching Protocol

### Weekly Review (Health Section)
Each weekly review should include:
1. Average scores for sleep/energy/clarity/mood
2. Training sessions completed vs planned
3. Weight trend (up/down/stable vs goal)
4. What helped this week? What hurt?
5. One health action item for next week

### Monthly Health Check
1. Review 4-week trends in all metrics
2. Adjust training plan if needed
3. Review nutrition approach (is the cut working?)
4. Check supplement protocol
5. Plan next blood work if due

### Quarterly Deep Review
1. Blood work comparison (if new results)
2. Body composition check
3. Reassess goals and targets
4. Review what's working and what's not
5. Adjust the system

## Upcoming: Post-Vasaloppet Ramp-Up

**Now that Vasaloppet is done, it's time to build the system:**
1. Book blood work — get your baseline
2. Start daily metric tracking in daily notes
3. Define training schedule
4. Set up sleep tracking
5. Start supplement baseline (D3, Omega-3, Magnesium)
6. Book KAN-kliniken assessment
