# Supplement Protocol

## Principle
Supplement based on blood work data and evidence, not hype. Test first, supplement second, retest to confirm. The goal is correcting deficiencies and optimizing what food alone can't cover.

## Current Protocol

### Pre-Blood-Work Baseline Stack
These are evidence-based supplements with high likelihood of benefit for a 30s male in Sweden.

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Why |
|-----------|------|--------|-----|
| Vitamin D3 | 4000 IU | Morning, with fat | Sweden = limited sun Oct-Mar. Almost certainly deficient. |
| Omega-3 (EPA/DHA) | 2g combined EPA+DHA | With meals | Anti-inflammatory, brain health, heart health. Hard to get enough from food. |
| Magnesium Glycinate | 300-400mg elemental | Before bed | Sleep quality, muscle recovery, stress. Glycinate form is best absorbed and calming. |

### Post-Blood-Work Adjustments
_To be updated after baseline blood work results._

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Reason (Blood Work Finding) |
|-----------|------|--------|---------------------------|
| — | — | — | _Waiting for results_ |

## What NOT to Take (Without Data)

- **Testosterone boosters** — Get tested first. If T is fine, these are a waste.
- **Iron** — Only supplement if ferritin is low. Too much iron is harmful.
- **B12 megadoses** — Check levels first. If you eat meat, you're probably fine.
- **Random multivitamins** — Shotgun approach. Underdosed on what matters, includes stuff you don't need.
- **Pre-workouts with proprietary blends** — Know what you're taking and why.

## What Might Be Added (Pending Blood Work)

| Supplement | When to Add | Typical Dose |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Vitamin K2 (MK-7)** | If taking D3 long-term (helps direct calcium properly) | 100-200 mcg |
| **B12 (methylcobalamin)** | If B12 <400 pmol/L | 1000 mcg/day |
| **Iron (bisglycinate)** | If ferritin <50 µg/L | 25-50mg, with vitamin C, away from coffee/tea |
| **Zinc** | If zinc is low or testosterone needs support | 15-30mg, with food |
| **Creatine monohydrate** | General — strong evidence for strength + cognition | 5g/day, any time |
| **Ashwagandha (KSM-66)** | If cortisol is elevated / high stress period | 600mg/day for 8-12 weeks |

## Shopping List (Sweden)

Good options available at:
- **Apoteket** — Pharmacy basics (D3, Omega-3, Magnesium)
- **Life** — Health food store chain
- **iHerb** — Online, wider selection, often cheaper
- **Bodystore.com** — Swedish online supplement store

## Review Schedule

- **Monthly:** Are you actually taking them consistently? Any side effects?
- **Quarterly (with blood work):** Adjust doses based on new results. Add or remove based on data.
