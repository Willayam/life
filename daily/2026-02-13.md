## Brain Dump

Big planning session. Captured everything floating around in my head.

### Financial / Bookkeeping
- Need to get bookkeeping done for rest of the year
- ~100K in company account, 13-15K already booked (pending outflow)
- 55K big expense from 2024 — defer booking until after salary payout
- Strategy: keep enough in account for salary, move surplus → savings → Tesla stock
- Need to find all office papers for bookkeeping
- Stripe reporting: separate Marcus costs (personal) from app/dev costs (company)

### Clarity.video
- New proposal approach: take the risk since revenue is low
- This will be much more work than last summer — need to review what I did then
- Max out design skills: glassmorphism, super clean UX
- Pricing: 50% profit share with $1,000 floor

### Maxa
- App QA is terrible — want to create a custom Claude skill for design QA
- Need Play Store submission so Olivia can test
- Want to implement claymorphism on site and app

### Building Projects
- Build an email classifier to zero out inbox
- Book Expo meeting for Thu/Fri next week (Feb 19-20)
- Try replicating Framer/Vaylo solution fully in code with agents

### Family / Personal
- Suggest to Jessica: swap one day during weekends (custody)
- House is messy — need to get it in order
  - Get office organized
  - Separate my stuff from Frida's so she can take responsibility for packing her own things
- Find office papers (double duty: organization + bookkeeping)

## Reflections

Lots of building ideas competing for attention. The priority stack is clear:
1. Bookkeeping + salary (time-sensitive, protects parental leave)
2. Clarity proposal (money)
3. Play Store submission (Maxa toward users)

Everything else is queue. Don't let the shiny stuff eat the important stuff.
