## Brain Dump

Big planning session. Captured everything floating around in my head.

### Financial / Bookkeeping
- Need to get bookkeeping done for rest of the year
- ~100K in company account, 13-15K already booked (pending outflow)
- 55K big expense from 2024 — defer booking until after salary payout
- Strategy: keep enough in account for salary, move surplus → savings → Tesla stock
- Need to find all office papers for bookkeeping
- Stripe reporting: separate Marcus costs (personal) from app/dev costs (company)

### Clarity.video
- New proposal approach: take the risk since revenue is low
- This will be much more work than last summer — need to review what I did then
- Max out design skills: glassmorphism, super clean UX
- Pricing: 50% profit share with $1,000 floor

### Maxa
- App QA is terrible — want to create a custom Claude skill for design QA
- Need Play Store submission so Olivia can test
- Want to implement claymorphism on site and app

### Building Projects
- Build an email classifier to zero out inbox
- Book Expo meeting for Thu/Fri next week (Feb 19-20)
- Try replicating Framer/Vaylo solution fully in code with agents

### Family / Personal
- Suggest to Jessica: swap one day during weekends (custody)
- House is messy — need to get it in order
  - Get office organized
  - Separate my stuff from Frida's so she can take responsibility for packing her own things
- Find office papers (double duty: organization + bookkeeping)

## Email Draft — Feeno Support

**To:** Feeno support
**Subject:** Brush sizing issue + add item to existing order

Hi,

I recently placed an order and tried to select my preferred brush size, but the sizing option doesn't seem to be working — I wasn't able to adjust it properly.

I'd also like to add a second brush to the same order as a gift for my girlfriend. Since the order is shipping internationally, it would be great if both items could be combined into one shipment to avoid separate shipping costs.

Could you help me with:
1. Fixing or adjusting the brush size on my original order
2. Adding a second brush to the same order

Happy to provide my order number or any other details you need.

Thanks,
William

## Reflections

Lots of building ideas competing for attention. The priority stack is clear:
1. Bookkeeping + salary (time-sensitive, protects parental leave)
2. Clarity proposal (money)
3. Play Store submission (Maxa toward users)

Everything else is queue. Don't let the shiny stuff eat the important stuff.
