# 2026-02-20 (Friday)

## Clarity Meeting — Full Team Call

**Attendees:** Todd Hartley, Mikey Brown, Joe, William
**Time:** 8:30 AM MST / 4:30 PM CET

### Outcome
Deal is moving forward. Profit share model agreed in principle. 2-3 month trial before equity conversation. William to create formal proposal document (done). Next meeting Thu Feb 26 to finalize and sign.

### Key Discussion Points

**Security (Critical)**
- Stripe credentials exposed in the web app — anyone can see payment keys
- Multiple other API keys hardcoded (OpenAI, AWS, Adobe)
- This is the #1 priority before anything else

**Technical State**
- Two different backends running simultaneously
- Angular frontend (complicates mobile dev)
- Basic UX flows not working reliably
- Agreed on "strangler pattern" approach: build new while gradually replacing old

**Business Mastery Booth Opportunity**
- Todd presenting day 2 (moved from day 4 for better timing)
- 300+ attendees recording testimonials at booth
- Live video review and feedback as the hook
- Auto Clarity account creation for lead gen
- **2-week window** to get proposal to Team Tony
- Todd scheduling the Team Tony follow-up meeting

**iMessage / App Store Distribution**
- Todd discovered third-party app creation opportunity (~80% approval)
- Early adopter advantage (like his Google News play — 36M visitors/year)
- Requires native iOS app (Angular is a blocker, strangler pattern sets foundation)
- Distribution play, not convenience — Track 3 priority

**AI Automation Ideas**
- Meeting transcript → auto-generated Journey Page proposal (Todd's 7-min prep → 0-min)
- Calendar integration: auto-create proposal pages for upcoming meetings
- Avatar video generation for camera-shy users (70% won't record themselves)

**Testimonial Platform ("Wall of Love")**
- Inspired by Senja (free up to 15, then paid tiers)
- Perfect for Tony's coaching audience
- White-label across all Tony Robbins events
- 5+ testimonials increase purchase intention 270%

### Action Items
- [x] William: Create detailed partnership proposal document → [proposal](../projects/clarity-proposal-2026-02.md)
- [ ] Todd: Schedule Team Tony follow-up meeting (2-week window)
- [ ] All: Develop bigger vision for booth opportunity before Thu call
- [ ] Thu Feb 26, 8:30 AM MST: Next meeting — finalize and sign

## Reflections

This is real. The energy in the meeting was strong — Todd sees the vision, Mikey is on board with the structure, and the Business Mastery booth is a concrete near-term opportunity that could be huge for lead gen. The key is to not let the excitement about future features (iMessage, avatars, testimonial platform) distract from the fundamentals: fix security, rebuild the creation flow, make it work.

Priority for Thursday's call: come with a tight proposal document (done) and a clear first-30-days plan. The booth opportunity adds urgency — if we can get the testimonial collection flow working for Business Mastery, that's both a demo and a lead gen engine.

This sits at priority #3 behind Maxa and Inkarnate. Don't let it creep into Maxa time.
