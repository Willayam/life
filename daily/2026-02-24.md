## Brain Dump

### Functional Patterns Training + KAN-kliniken

Interested in doing Functional Patterns-style training. Found [KAN-kliniken](https://www.kankliniken.se/) — a chiropractic clinic on Döbelnsgatan 57, Stockholm that offers Functional Patterns training alongside chiropractic, massage, shockwave therapy, and running analysis.

**What they offer:**
- Chiropractic care + joint manipulation

- Shockwave & laser therapy
- Diagnostic ultrasound

**Contact:** +46 8 21 15 05 / info@kankliniken.se

**Next step:** Book an initial private evaluation/training session to get assessed and discuss a training approach.

### Heaper — Local-First Digital Workspace / File OS

Saw a video about [Heaper](https://heaper.de/) — a local-first, linked note-taking application that works across notes, media, and files. Could be interesting as a unified storage/file management layer for the life system.

**What Heaper is:**
- Local-first digital workspace — data stays on your device with optional sync
- Block-based architecture where everything (docs, workspaces, files) are interconnected blocks
- Uses CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for real-time collaboration without merge conflicts
- Rich media support: text, attachments, thumbnails, full-text search
- Self-hosting option for full data control
- Available on web (in dev), desktop (Electron), and mobile (Capacitor)

**Resources:**
- Website: https://heaper.de/
- Docs: https://docs.heaper.de/
- Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd_v_3CcVno

**Idea: Mac Mini as local home server**
- Get a Mac Mini to act as a local server
- Always-on access to files and storage
- Run AI locally on that machine, connected to all storage drives
- Automated backups of everything
- Could self-host Heaper (or similar) on it
- Centralized hub for the life OS infrastructure

**Why this matters:** Having a local-first setup means no dependency on cloud services, full ownership of data, and the ability to run AI tools against all personal files without uploading anything to third parties.

**Status:** Future project — explore when bandwidth allows. Not a priority over Maxa.
