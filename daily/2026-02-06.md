## Brain Dump

Set up the Life OS repository with Claude. Did a deep discovery session covering finances, health, family, projects, and goals. System is now live with RPM framework across all life areas.

Feeling frustrated with Maxa not being shipped yet. The question extraction is the blocker. Want to get that done in days, not weeks.

## Wins

- Full Life OS initialized with real data
- Skills installed (create-agent-skills, agent-browser)
- Clear financial picture: 90K income, 200K debt, 60K/month surplus
- Parental leave optimization identified as urgent

## Frustrations / Blocks

- Maxa question extraction taking longer than expected
- Salary has been inconsistent - need to fix for SGI immediately

## Ideas

- E-bike for preschool commute (company lease)
- "Taught my dad Claude Code" content series
- Frida's school offer could share distribution with Maxa

## Actions Taken

- Initialized complete Life OS
- Set up Obsidian vault structure
- Created financial strategy, health dashboard, content plan, family plan

## Tomorrow

Get back on Maxa question extraction. That's the ONE thing.
