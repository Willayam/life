## Meeting Prep: Erik Karlsson (Vaylo) - Expa Handoff

### Context
Erik is the new project leader at Vaylo, taking over the Expo/Expa Travel project. Goal is to get him fully up to speed and establish a weekly cadence to close out the transition cleanly.

---

### Suggested Agenda (30 min)

**1. Introductions & Context (5 min)**
- Your background with the project - how long, what you built
- Erik's background - what he knows so far, what Vaylo's role is

**2. Project Status Overview (10 min)**
- Current state of the codebase / product
- What's live, what's in progress, what's broken
- Tech stack overview (Expo / React Native)
- Hosting, deployments, environments
- Key integrations and third-party services

**3. Open Items to Hand Off (10 min)**
- **Expa NO questions (from Feb 5 email):**
  1. Will mobile number be mandatory in next update?
  2. Will email double-checking be added?
  3. Will Expa logo be visible on the widget?
- These need answers from whoever owns the project going forward
- **Catrine:** Needs explicit confirmation that Erik is now the contact for all changes
- Any other pending requests or bugs

**4. Working Cadence Going Forward (5 min)**
- Propose: **Weekly 30-min sync** for the next 4-6 weeks
  - Purpose: Answer questions as they come up, smooth transition
  - After that: Erik is fully autonomous, William exits
- Define communication channel (Slack? Email? Teams?)
- Set expectations: William is available for questions but not doing active development

### Key Points to Communicate

1. **You're winding down** - Be clear that this is a transition, not an ongoing collaboration. You haven't been paid since October 2025.

2. **Erik owns it now** - All new feature requests, bugs, and questions from Catrine/Expa NO should go to Erik.

3. **Weekly meetings are temporary** - 4-6 weeks to transfer knowledge, then you're done.

4. **Document everything** - Ask Erik to note down questions between meetings so you can batch-answer them efficiently.

### What You Need FROM Erik

- [ ] Confirmation he has access to: repo, hosting/deployment, any admin panels

- [ ] A list of what he's already reviewed / understands
- [ ] His timeline - when does Vaylo expect him to be fully running this?

### What You Need TO DO After Meeting

- [ ] Send Catrine a clear message: "All changes and questions go to Erik now"
- [ ] Share any remaining documentation, credentials, or access
- [ ] Set up recurring weekly calendar invite (30 min, 4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Update projects/active.md to reflect handoff status
