## Part 1: Which Sports Extend Life the Most?

### The Copenhagen City Heart Study (Schnohr et al., 2018)

The landmark study. 8,577 participants followed for 25 years. Life expectancy gains vs sedentary:

| Sport | Life Expectancy Gain | Social? |
|-------|---------------------|---------|
| Tennis | **+9.7 years** | Yes |
| Badminton | **+6.2 years** | Yes |
| Soccer | **+4.7 years** | Yes |
| Cycling | +3.7 years | Sometimes |
| Swimming | +3.4 years | Sometimes |
| Jogging | +3.2 years | No |
| Calisthenics | +3.1 years | No |
| Gym/health club | +1.5 years | No |

The same group found an optimal dose of **2.6-4.5 hours/week** of total leisure sports - a U-shaped curve where both zero and >10 hours showed slightly worse outcomes.

### The British Cohort Study (Oja et al., BJSM 2017)

80,306 adults, 9-year follow-up. All-cause mortality reduction:

| Sport | Mortality Reduction |
|-------|-------------------|
| Racquet sports | **47%** |
| Swimming | **28%** |
| Aerobics | **27%** |
| Cycling | 15% |

Cardiovascular mortality: racquet sports showed a **56% reduction** - the strongest of any activity.

### Gymnasts and Pole Vaulters: The Multi-Capacity Sports

These deserve special attention because they combine strength, power, flexibility, coordination, and cardiovascular fitness -- the full spectrum of physical capacity.

- **Pole vaulting: +8.4 years** life expectancy gain for male athletes
- **Gymnastics: +8.2 years** life expectancy gain

These rival racquet sports for longevity benefit. The proposed mechanism: training that simultaneously develops strength through full range of motion, explosive power, proprioception/balance, connective tissue resilience, and high strength-to-weight ratio. These athletes maintain diverse physical qualities rather than specializing in a single energy system.

**Study quality caveat:** These numbers come from observational studies on elite athletes with significant selection bias and confounding (socioeconomic status, post-career lifestyle, healthcare access). The systematic review (Garatachea et al., 2014) covering 465,575 athletes across 57 studies noted: only 1.2% female representation, inconsistent statistical methods across studies, and limited post-retirement follow-up data. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality scores were generally high (32/54 scored 8/9), but the fundamental confound -- that healthier people self-select into athletics -- cannot be eliminated.

### Elite Athlete Longevity Data

**Finnish Elite Athletes Study** (Sarna et al., 1993) - 2,613 athletes vs 1,712 controls:
- Endurance sports: **+5.7 years** (HR 0.49 for CV mortality)
- Team sports: **+4.0 years** (HR 0.61)
- Power sports: **+1.6 years**

**Olympic Medalists** (Clarke et al., BMJ 2012): +2.8 years vs general population across 15,174 medalists. High-collision sports (boxing) showed 11% higher mortality than low-collision sports.

**Systematic Review** (Garatachea et al., Sports Medicine Open 2015): 54 peer-reviewed studies, 465,575 athletes. All-cause SMR = 0.67 (33% lower mortality). Tour de France cyclists SMR = 0.59. Endurance and mixed-sport athletes consistently outlived power athletes.

**US Olympians** (2020 study): US Olympic athletes live **5 years longer** than their general population counterparts (n=8,124).

**Meta-analysis of 165,000 athletes** (Ruiz et al., Sports Medicine 2021): Elite athletes consistently show lower mortality, primarily from reduced cardiovascular disease. Endurance athletes benefit most.

### The Running Meta-Analysis (Pedisic et al., BJSM 2020)

232,149 participants, 14 studies: Running = **27% lower all-cause mortality**, 30% lower CV mortality. Even running once per week or 50 minutes total was sufficient. No dose-response trend - more wasn't necessarily better.

## Part 2: Why These Sports Extend Life (Proxies vs Causes)

**Critical framing: VO2max and grip strength are receipts, not meals.** They are composite readouts of underlying system health. A 2024 Mendelian randomization study found that genetically predicted VO2max is NOT causally associated with longevity -- it's the *process of building and maintaining fitness* that extends life, not the number itself. The same logic applies to grip strength: having strong hands doesn't save you, but the systemic health that produces strong hands does.

### What VO2max Actually Reflects (The Fick Equation)

VO2max = (Heart Rate x Stroke Volume) x (Arterial O2 - Venous O2)

A high VO2max requires seven systems working simultaneously:

1. **Heart:** Eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy -- bigger chamber, more blood per beat. Unlike disease-caused hypertrophy, exercise-induced remodeling includes matching angiogenesis.
2. **Endothelium:** Exercise shear stress upregulates nitric oxide (NO). NO dilates arteries, prevents plaque, is anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic. Endothelial dysfunction is the FIRST step in atherosclerosis -- this may be the most direct causal link to cardiovascular disease prevention.
3. **Capillary density:** New capillary growth via HIF-1-alpha and VEGF. More surface area for oxygen exchange. Declines with aging but reversible with training.
4. **Mitochondria:** PGC-1-alpha drives biogenesis and quality control (fusion/fission). Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to metabolic disease and cellular aging.
5. **Metabolic flexibility:** Ability to switch between fat and glucose as fuel sources. Directly prevents insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
6. **Inflammation:** Contracting muscles release IL-6 as a myokine, triggering anti-inflammatory cascades (IL-10, IL-1ra) while suppressing TNF-alpha. This is the primary defense against "inflammaging."
7. **Autonomic nervous system:** High fitness = parasympathetic dominance at rest (lower resting HR, higher HRV). Linked to lower inflammation and cardiovascular protection.

**Which of these actually prevent death?** The strongest causal evidence: (1) anti-inflammatory effects -- chronic inflammation underlies CVD, cancer, and neurodegeneration, (2) endothelial function -- directly prevents atherosclerosis initiation, (3) mitochondrial quality control -- prevents cellular energy failure, (4) metabolic resilience -- insulin sensitivity prevents the diseases that kill most people, (5) cardiac reserve -- a strong heart survives acute stressors (infection, surgery) that overwhelm a weak one.

### The Reserve Capacity Math

VO2max declines ~10%/decade after 25, accelerating to ~15-20% after 50. Functional independence requires ~18 ml/kg/min. A 50-year-old at VO2max 45 doesn't hit the threshold until ~95+. A 50-year-old at 25 hits it at ~70. Every ml/kg/min you build now is a buffer against age-related decline. You are training for the version of yourself at 80 who needs to recover from pneumonia or climb stairs.

### What Grip Strength Actually Reflects

Grip strength is NOT primarily a muscle measure -- it's a **nervous system measure**. Maximum force production requires recruiting thousands of motor units simultaneously. The hand has outsized motor cortex representation. Declining grip reflects:

1. **Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) integrity:** The interface between motor neurons and muscle fibers degrades with age -- reduced neurotransmitter release, decreased receptor density. You can have the muscle but fail to activate it. This is why sarcopenia criteria shifted from "low mass" to "low strength."
2. **Muscle as endocrine organ (myokines):** Contracting muscle secretes hundreds of signaling molecules. IL-6 (anti-inflammatory in exercise context), irisin (converts white to brown fat, crosses blood-brain barrier, stimulates BDNF for neurogenesis, inhibits cancer signaling), SPARC (tumor suppression). Less functional muscle = less myokine signaling = loss of systemic protection.
3. **Hormonal status:** Correlates with testosterone, GH, IGF-1 -- all decline with age and all support both muscle and broader systemic health.
4. **Biological age:** DNA methylation clocks correlate with grip strength. It tracks molecular aging, not just physical aging.

In short: grip strength integrates neural integrity + muscle quality + hormonal milieu + inflammatory status + nutritional adequacy + vascular health + biological age into a single number. That's why it outperforms any single biomarker.

**Muscle quality > muscle quantity:** Older adults with low muscle *strength* have 2.6x greater risk of severe mobility limitation and 2.1x greater mortality -- even after adjusting for muscle *mass*. A well-innervated, mitochondrially dense muscle that's free of fat infiltration produces more force per unit area than a large but "marbled" muscle.

See [[grip-strength-as-proxy-what-it-really-measures]] and [[vo2max-mechanistic-biology]] for full deep dives.

### Social Connection - The Hidden Multiplier

Holt-Lunstad's meta-analyses (2010, 2015): Social isolation = same mortality risk as **smoking 15 cigarettes/day** (OR 1.29). This likely explains why tennis (+9.7 years) crushes jogging (+3.2 years) despite similar exertion -- the social element compounds the physical benefit through stress buffering, accountability, cognitive engagement, and sense of belonging.

### The Multi-Capacity Hypothesis (Why Gymnasts and Pole Vaulters Do So Well)

Sports requiring diverse physical qualities -- strength through range of motion, explosive power, flexibility, coordination, proprioception, and cardiovascular fitness simultaneously -- may provide the best longevity outcomes. Gymnastics (+8.2 years) and pole vaulting (+8.4 years) develop the full spectrum rather than specializing. This includes:
- **Connective tissue resilience:** Tendons, ligaments, and fascia adapt to varied loading. Collagen production declines ~75% by age 80; training through full ROM slows this.
- **Proprioception and balance:** Falls kill >10,000 people 65+ yearly. Balance training reduces falls by 23-50%. Sports like gymnastics build proprioception as a core requirement.
- **Strength-to-weight ratio:** Maintaining low body fat + high relative strength is metabolically protective and reduces joint stress.

### Other Mechanisms

**Mitochondrial health (Zone 2):** Training at lactate <2 mmol/L drives mitochondrial biogenesis, MCT-1 transporter upregulation, and maximizes fat oxidation capacity. Protocol: 3-4x/week, 45-60 min (San Millan/Attia).

**Telomere preservation:** Werner RCT (2019, European Heart Journal): 6 months of endurance or HIIT training increased telomerase activity 2-3x. Resistance training did NOT affect telomeres. Ultra-endurance athletes show 11% longer telomeres (~16 years less biological aging).

**Hormetic stress:** Exercise triggers Nrf-2, AMPK, SIRT1, FOXO3, and heat shock proteins. Cold exposure adds norepinephrine (+200-300%), cold shock proteins (RBM3 for neuroprotection), and brown fat activation.

**Dose-response (Arem et al., 2015, JAMA Internal Medicine, 661,137 participants):** 70% of the maximum mortality benefit comes from just 150 min/week. Max benefit plateaus at 450-750 min/week (~39% reduction). No harm even at 10x guidelines. The curve is steepest at the bottom -- going from nothing to something is the single biggest gain.

### Study Quality and Limitations

All longevity-by-sport studies are **observational with significant confounders:**
- **Selection bias:** Healthier, wealthier people self-select into certain sports (tennis = higher SES). Studies adjust for confounders but can't eliminate them.
- **Survivor bias:** Athletes who competed long enough to appear in databases already survived youth. Those who dropped out due to injury/illness are missing.
- **Post-career lifestyle unknown:** Most studies don't track what athletes do after retirement. Do tennis players stay active? Do powerlifters stop?
- **Sample limitations:** Female athletes represent only ~1.2% of the systematic review data (Garatachea 2015). Most data is on white males from wealthy countries.
- **Causation gap:** The Mendelian randomization finding on VO2max is a reminder that correlation (high fitness = less death) doesn't prove the fitness itself is causal -- the behaviors that build fitness are likely the true cause.

## Part 3: Working Backwards from Death

Instead of asking "which sport gives the most years?" the better question is: **"What actually kills people, and what physical capacities would have prevented it?"**

### The Causes of Death That Exercise Can Prevent

**Ages 65+, leading causes (CDC):**
1. Heart disease (~25-30% of deaths)
2. Cancer (~20%)
3. COVID/respiratory disease (~8-10%)
4. Cerebrovascular disease/stroke (~6%)
5. Alzheimer's/dementia (~5-6%, rising 3% per year)
6. Unintentional injuries including falls (~4%, rising 1.2% per year)
7. Diabetes (~3%)

### The Failure Chains: Cause of Death → Physical Failure → Trainable Quality

**1. FALLS → FRACTURE → DEATH (The Silent Killer)**

Hip fracture 1-year mortality: **22-30%** (up to 54% for nursing home men). This is a death sentence disguised as an orthopedic injury. 87-96% occur in people 65+.

```
The failure chain:
Lost balance (vestibular decline, proprioception loss)
  → Failed to catch yourself (insufficient reactive power, slow neuromuscular response)
    → Hit the ground hard (no muscle mass to absorb impact)
      → Bone broke (osteoporosis from years of insufficient loading)
        → Hospitalized → immobilized → pneumonia/blood clot → dead
```

**Trainable qualities that break this chain:**
- **Balance + proprioception** → single-leg work, unstable surfaces, eyes-closed drills
- **Reactive power** (force × velocity) → explosive movements, jump training, medicine ball throws
- **Lower body strength** → squats, deadlifts, step-ups
- **Bone density** → heavy resistance training + impact loading (jumping, stairs). Swimming and cycling do NOT build bone -- confirmed by systematic review of 18 studies.
- **Muscle mass** → padding around joints + buffer against immobility-induced wasting

Exercise reduces falls by **21-39%** in community-dwelling elderly (meta-analysis). Balance-focused programs with >3 hrs/week of challenging exercise achieve the 39% number.

**2. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE → HEART ATTACK/STROKE → DEATH**

```
The failure chain:
Chronic inflammation + metabolic dysfunction
  → Endothelial dysfunction (the FIRST step)
    → Atherosclerotic plaque builds over decades
      → Plaque ruptures or artery blocks
        → Heart attack or stroke
          → Cardiac arrest or brain death
```

OR during acute illness:

```
Infection/surgery/trauma
  → Cardiac demand spikes (need to pump harder)
    → Insufficient cardiac reserve (weak heart, low stroke volume)
      → Heart fails under the stress
```

**Trainable qualities that break this chain:**
- **Endothelial function** → aerobic exercise (shear stress → nitric oxide production)
- **Cardiac reserve** → VO2max training (bigger stroke volume, stronger heart)
- **Anti-inflammatory state** → any regular exercise (myokine signaling suppresses TNF-alpha, CRP)
- **Metabolic flexibility** → Zone 2 training (fat oxidation, insulin sensitivity)
- **Blood pressure regulation** → combined aerobic + resistance training

**3. CANCER → METASTASIS → DEATH**

Exercise reduces risk of 13+ cancer types (NCI meta-analysis):
- Colon: **20-24% reduction**
- Breast: **12-21% reduction**
- Bladder, endometrial, esophageal, renal, gastric: **10-20% reduction**
- Cancer survivors who exercise: **40-50% lower cancer-specific mortality**

```
The failure chain:
Chronic inflammation + high insulin/IGF-1 + poor immune surveillance
  → Damaged cells escape immune detection
    → Tumor grows in inflammatory, high-insulin environment
      → Metastasis → death
```

**Trainable qualities that break this chain:**
- **Muscle mass (myokine factory)** → irisin inhibits cancer signaling (PI3K, Akt, mTOR, NF-kB), SPARC suppresses tumor growth
- **Low body fat** → reduces chronic inflammation, lowers insulin/IGF-1
- **Immune function** → regular moderate exercise enhances NK cell surveillance
- **Metabolic health** → exercise reduces the hyperinsulinemia that fuels many cancers

**4. DEMENTIA → LOSS OF SELF → DEATH**

Exercise reduces dementia risk by **20-45%** (range across studies; Framingham Heart Study, 160,000 participants: 45% for highest activity). Midlife exercise has the strongest protective effect.

```
The failure chain:
Neuroinflammation + cerebrovascular damage + reduced neuroplasticity
  → Hippocampal atrophy + amyloid accumulation
    → Memory loss → cognitive decline → loss of independence
      → Aspiration pneumonia, falls, inability to self-care → death
```

**Trainable qualities that break this chain:**
- **Aerobic fitness** → increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), drives hippocampal neurogenesis, maintains cerebrovascular health
- **Coordination + motor complexity** → complex movements (dance, racquet sports, martial arts) challenge the brain's motor-cognitive networks
- **Cardiovascular health** → the brain receives 20% of cardiac output. A healthy heart = a well-perfused brain.
- **Social engagement** → socially demanding exercise (team/partner sports) compounds the cognitive benefit

**5. FRAILTY → LOSS OF INDEPENDENCE → DEATH**

This is the slow one. Not a single event but a cascade of decline that ends in institutionalization, then death.

```
The failure chain:
Gradual muscle loss (sarcopenia, -3-5%/decade after 30)
  → Reduced movement → reduced calorie needs → reduced appetite
    → Less protein intake → accelerated muscle loss
      → Can't get off toilet → can't climb stairs → can't carry groceries
        → Loss of independence → nursing home → depression + immobility → death
```

**Functional independence thresholds (Attia's "Centenarian Decathlon"):**
- Get off the floor with max one arm of support
- Carry 10 lbs per hand up 3 flights of stairs
- Lift a 20-lb suitcase overhead
- Pick up a 30-lb child from the floor
- Hike 1.5 miles on uneven terrain
- Do 5 pull-ups
- Balance on one leg for 30 seconds (eyes open)

**Hard thresholds from geriatric medicine:**
- VO2max below ~18 ml/kg/min = can't live independently
- Grip strength below 27 kg (men) / 16 kg (women) = probable sarcopenia
- Gait speed below 1.0 m/s = mortality risk factor; each 0.1 m/s faster = 23-25% lower mortality
- Can't stand from chair without arms = below functional threshold

### The Critical Insight: POWER Declines Fastest

This is the most important training insight from all the research:

**Rate of decline by physical quality:**

| Quality | Decline Rate | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Muscle power** (force × velocity) | **-1.1 to -2.4%/year** | Fastest decline. In mobility-limited elderly, power is reduced 95% while mass is only reduced 25%. |
| VO2max | -5.5 to -12%/decade | Active vs sedentary makes a 2x difference in decline rate |
| Muscle mass | -3-5%/decade (30-50), -10-20%/decade (50+) | Accelerates with age |
| Bone density | ~-1%/year (women post-menopause) | Men at roughly half the female rate |
| Balance/proprioception | Progressive, sharp inflection at 75 | Fall risk doubles after 75 |

**Power = force × velocity.** It's what allows you to catch yourself when you trip, stand up quickly, react to threats. Most people train slow and heavy (force only). Almost nobody trains fast. But the velocity component degrades 2-3x faster than the force component.

**This means:** Heavy squats alone are insufficient. You also need explosive movements -- box jumps, medicine ball throws, kettlebell swings, power cleans, or simply standing up from a chair as fast as possible. Training the velocity component is the single most undertrained and fastest-declining quality.

### The Work-Backwards-From-80 Math

If you need a VO2max of 18 at age 85, and it declines ~10%/decade (active) to ~15%/decade (sedentary):
- Active 50-year-old needs VO2max ≥30 today → stays above 18 at 85
- Sedentary 50-year-old at VO2max 25 → hits 18 at ~70, dependent by 75
- Active 50-year-old at VO2max 45 → doesn't hit 18 until 95+

Attia's rule: aim for top 10-20% fitness for your age now so you have margin at 80-90. You're not training for today. You're training for the 80-year-old version of yourself who needs to survive pneumonia, catch himself on a curb, or climb three flights of stairs.

### The Training Priority Stack (Ordered by What Kills You)

Based on cause-of-death data, failure chain analysis, and rate of physical decline:

| Priority | Quality | Why | What Trains It |
|----------|---------|-----|----------------|
| 1 | **Explosive power** | Fastest declining, prevents falls, needed for reactive balance | KB swings, jumps, medicine ball throws, power cleans |
| 2 | **Cardiorespiratory fitness** | #1 mortality predictor, cardiac reserve for acute illness | HIIT (Norwegian 4x4, Tabata) + Zone 2 |
| 3 | **Muscle strength + mass** | Myokine factory, metabolic health, functional independence | Heavy compound lifts 2x/week |
| 4 | **Balance + proprioception** | Fall prevention (22-30% hip fracture mortality at 1 year) | Single-leg work, unstable surfaces, eyes-closed drills |
| 5 | **Bone density** | Prevents fractures that start the death cascade | Heavy resistance + impact loading (NOT swimming/cycling) |
| 6 | **Metabolic health** | Prevents diabetes, feeds cancer prevention | Zone 2 + resistance training + body composition |
| 7 | **Cognitive stimulation** | 20-45% dementia risk reduction | Complex/social movement (racquet sports, dance, martial arts) |

See [[functional-capacity-thresholds]] for full threshold data and decline rates.

## Part 4: The 80/20 for Lean, Strong, and Conditioned

### What the Research Says About Minimum Effective Dose

**Strength:**
- 2x/week full-body captures 80%+ of strength/hypertrophy gains (Schoenfeld meta-analyses, 2016, 2019)
- 8-12 sets per muscle group per week is the sweet spot for building
- Maintenance requires only 2-5 sets/muscle/week
- Compound movements only at this frequency -- no isolation needed

**VO2max (the biggest longevity lever):**
- Norwegian 4x4: 4 rounds of 4 min at 90-95% max HR, 3 min recovery = 25 min. Produces 7-13% VO2max gains in 8-10 weeks with just 2-3 sessions/week.
- Tabata: 8 rounds of 20s all-out / 10s rest = 4 min. Produces 9-15% VO2max improvement.
- 1-2 HIIT sessions/week = massive cardiovascular return on minimal time.

**Aerobic base (Zone 2):**
- Needs 45+ minute sessions for the mitochondrial adaptations to kick in
- 3+ hours/week for real aerobic base building
- Best modalities: cycling, rowing, brisk walking uphill

**Body composition:**
- Caloric deficit > protein > resistance training > NEAT > formal cardio
- NEAT (steps, active commuting, standing) can vary by 2,000 kcal/day between people
- 8,000+ daily steps as baseline is more impactful than any single workout

**The interference effect is overblown** for non-elite athletes. Separate strength and cardio by 3-6 hours when possible, prefer cycling/rowing over running for Zone 2.

### The Combined Exercise Meta-Analysis (Lopez-Bueno et al., JAMA Internal Medicine 2023)

~500,000 adults. Combined aerobic + muscle-strengthening activity: **~50% lower all-cause mortality** and **~3x lower CV mortality**. This is the strongest mortality reduction of any exercise approach studied.

The Shailendra et al. (2022) meta-analysis found resistance training's sweet spot at **60 minutes/week** for maximum mortality reduction (27% lower all-cause mortality).

## Part 5: Practical Frameworks

### The Minimum Viable Training Week (~3-3.5 hrs)

| Day | What | Time |
|-----|------|------|
| Mon | Full-body strength (squat, hinge, push, pull, carry) | 40 min |
| Tue | Zone 2 walk/bike | 45 min |
| Wed | Rest (NEAT focus: 10K steps) | -- |
| Thu | Full-body strength + HIIT finisher (Tabata) | 45 min |
| Fri | Rest | -- |
| Sat | Zone 2 outdoor (with Charlie) | 45-60 min |
| Sun | McGill Big 3 + mobility | 15 min |

Daily: McGill Big 3 as morning routine (5-10 min). 8,000+ steps.

### The Sweet Spot (~5 hrs/week)

| Day | What | Time |
|-----|------|------|
| Mon | Strength: lower body + McGill warm-up | 50 min |
| Tue | Zone 2 (cycling/rowing) | 50 min |
| Wed | Strength: upper body + McGill warm-up | 50 min |
| Thu | Zone 2 (cycling/rowing) | 50 min |
| Fri | Strength: full-body + Norwegian 4x4 HIIT | 55 min |
| Sat | Zone 2 outdoor (long session) | 60 min |
| Sun | Mobility + light movement | 20 min |

### The Kettlebell Minimalist (~3.5-4 hrs/week)

One kettlebell, no gym needed. Based on Pavel's Simple & Sinister.

| Day | What | Time |
|-----|------|------|
| Mon | 100 KB swings + 10 Turkish get-ups | 25 min |
| Tue | Zone 2 (walk/bike/row) | 45 min |
| Wed | 100 KB swings + 10 TGU | 25 min |
| Thu | Zone 2 + Tabata finisher | 50 min |
| Fri | 100 KB swings + 10 TGU | 25 min |
| Sat | Zone 2 outdoor (long) | 60 min |
| Sun | McGill Big 3 + mobility | 15 min |

Add pull-ups on S&S days (grease the groove: 3-5 sets spread through the day).

### The Social Multiplier

Add one racquet sport session per week to any of the above. Tennis or padel 1x/week could be the single highest-ROI addition -- it adds the social connection mechanism that accounts for much of the 6+ year gap between racquet sports and solo exercise.

---

## Part 6: The Core Movements

If you could only do 5 exercises forever:

1. **KB Swing or Deadlift** -- hinge, posterior chain, conditioning
2. **Squat** (goblet, front, or back) -- knee-dominant lower body
3. **Push-up or Overhead Press** -- upper push
4. **Row or Pull-up** -- upper pull
5. **Farmer's Walk** -- loaded carry, grip strength, core

Add **Turkish Get-Ups** for rotation, stability, and mobility in one movement.

Add **McGill Big 3** daily for spine health: modified curl-up, side plank, bird dog. 5-10 minutes. Non-negotiable for desk workers.
