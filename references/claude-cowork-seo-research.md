## What Claude Cowork Actually Does for SEO

Claude Cowork launched January 2026. It's an autonomous AI agent inside the Claude desktop app. You give it a task, point it at a folder or website, and it executes — reading files, opening Chrome, visiting pages, running analysis across multiple tabs, and delivering structured outputs (spreadsheets, reports) locally.

### The Full Workflow (15 Prompts, End-to-End)

Based on multiple sources (The AI Corner, MTSoln, Ferventers, AI Maker Labs):

**1. Research & Competitive Intelligence**
- Map competitive landscape automatically
- Reverse-engineer competitor keyword strategy
- Find content gaps worth filling
- Extract and compile competitor Google Business Profile data (reviews, keywords, photos, profile completeness)
- Creates a "ranking factor hypothesis" specific to your niche

**2. Keyword Research**
- Two workflows: one for local/service businesses, one for SaaS/online
- Focused on revenue-driving keywords, not vanity metrics
- "Prompt-shaped" keyword targeting (queries that AI users actually ask)

**3. Technical Audits**
- Full site health checks
- Schema markup validation + JSON-LD generation
- Internal linking analysis
- Codebase analysis for technical SEO debt (using Claude Code "Ultra-Think")
- The diagnostic work agencies charge $2K+ for

**4. Content Optimization**
- On-page scoring for existing pages
- Pre-publish checklists for new content
- E-E-A-T analysis against Google's Sep 2025 Quality Rater Guidelines
- Citation-ready scorecard (if score < 70, don't publish)

**5. Local SEO Specific**
- Competitor-informed Google Business Profile post generation
- Full 30-day GBP posting calendar
- Review volume optimization strategy
- Business name keyword optimization
- 24/7 availability signals

**6. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**
- Optimizing content to be cited by AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overviews)
- This is how modern SEO is done in 2026 — not a separate service

**7. Reporting & Ongoing**
- Monthly SEO reporting automated
- Outputs in Excel or PDF format
- Can execute recommended changes directly

### Results People Are Getting
- Competitor analysis: 3-4 hours → 12 minutes
- Technical audits that required $200/mo tools + specialist → one prompt
- Output quality on par with mid-tier agencies ($5K-$10K/month)
- UK B2B teams saving ~11 hours/week on campaign production

### Claude Skills (Repeatable Workflows)
- Save instruction sets as "Skills" for tasks you do repeatedly
- Trigger with simple prompts: "optimize this for SEO"
- Claude loads the Skill, runs the entire workflow, creates SEO-revised version
- Create skills for: landing page audits, competitor analysis, answer engine optimization

### The CLAUDE.md Approach
- A system file that gives Claude context before any SEO task
- Makes Claude "think like a senior SEO before it writes a single word"
- Every time you correct Claude, it writes a rule to never repeat that mistake
- Compound learning system — gets better over time

## Market Context: SEO Pricing in 2026

| Service Level | Monthly Price | What You Get |
|---|---|---|
| Budget/automated | $150-$500/mo | Almost nothing — red flag |
| Small business local SEO | $2,000-$4,000/mo | Quality local SEO |
| Mid-tier agency | $5,000-$10,000/mo | Full-service SEO |
| Premium agency | $10,000+/mo | Enterprise-level |

**The opportunity:** Claude Cowork can deliver mid-tier agency quality ($5K-$10K value) for the cost of a Claude subscription ($20-$200/mo) + your time setting it up and managing it.

## How This Applies to William's Projects

### For Yourself (Personal Brand + Maxa)
- **Maxa SEO:** Use Claude Cowork to do full keyword research for "högskoleprovet" search terms. Technical audit of the Maxa site. Content strategy for organic traffic. This is free distribution for your app.
- **Personal brand SEO:** Optimize your content for AI citations (GEO). When you start creating content, every piece can be SEO-optimized from day one.
- **Build in public angle:** "I used Claude to do $10K/mo agency-level SEO for my app for free" is perfect content for your brand.
- **CLAUDE.md for your projects:** Create SEO-focused CLAUDE.md files for Maxa that compound over time.

### For Expa (Get Paid)
- **The pitch:** "I'll set up AI-powered SEO for Expa's web presence using Claude — competitor analysis, GBP optimization, content strategy, technical audit. This is the same work agencies charge $3-5K/month for."
- **Pricing:** Charge $2,000-$4,000/month for ongoing SEO management. Your actual time investment: a few hours/month with Claude doing the heavy lifting.
- **Scope for Expa:** GBP optimization (travel is highly local), competitor keyword analysis, technical site audit, content calendar, monthly reporting.
- **Leverage dad:** Bill is at Expa SE — he can champion this internally. Position it as a separate paid engagement, not part of your old dev work.

### For Clarity.video
- **Already in the deal:** You're doing a 50/50 profit share. Better SEO = more organic traffic = more revenue = bigger split for you.
- **Immediate wins:** Technical SEO audit of Clarity (they have two backends running, technical debt). Fix schema markup, internal linking, site speed.
- **Content/GEO:** Optimize Clarity for AI citations. When people ask AI "best video testimonial tools" or "video coaching platforms" — Clarity should be cited.
- **Tony Robbins angle:** SEO for "Business Mastery" + "testimonial" + "coaching video" keywords. Todd presenting at Business Mastery = content opportunity.
- **Don't charge extra:** This is part of your product partnership. Better SEO = more revenue = you earn more through profit share.

### For Inkarnate
- **Already a workstream:** "Website landing page" is listed as one of your current workstreams.
- **Pitch expansion:** "In addition to the landing page, let me set up ongoing SEO. Inkarnate's competitor landscape, keyword gaps, technical audit, content strategy."
- **Pricing:** Either include it in your 90K/month scope or pitch as an add-on ($2-4K/mo on top).
- **Inkarnate specifics:** Keywords around "fantasy map maker," "D&D map creator," "RPG map tool," "tabletop maps." Marketplace SEO for map assets. GEO optimization so AI tools recommend Inkarnate.
