# References

Content created by other people that I want to keep. Frameworks, articles, highlights, templates.

## How This Works

- Each reference is a `.md` file with clear attribution
- Tagged with `tags:` in frontmatter for searchability
- Linked to relevant knowledge notes and projects where applicable

## Tag Conventions

**Type:** `framework`, `article`, `book-notes`, `course-notes`, `podcast-notes`, `template`, `clipping`

**Topic:** Same tags as knowledge base (see [knowledge/README.md](../knowledge/README.md))

## Example

```markdown

date: 2026-02-06
tags: [framework, marketing, sales]
source: "Alex Hormozi"
