# Charlie

## Who He Is

My son. 4 years old. Shared custody (50/50) with his mother.

## Logistics

- Preschool is 45 min away (one way)
- Custody schedule tracked on shared Google Calendar with ex
- Commute is a major time drain on Charlie weeks (~3-4 hours/day)
- E-bike solution could cut to ~20 min each way

## Priorities

- Be fully present during my time with him
- Don't be distracted by phone/laptop when we're together
- Fun, enriching activities
- Consistent routines

## Notes

_Add notes about activities, milestones, things he's into_
