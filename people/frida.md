# Frida

## Who She Is

My partner and love. PhD sleep researcher. Entrepreneur. We live together in Stockholm. Pregnant with our first child together (due end of July 2026).

## Her Work

- PhD in sleep research
- Wants to build a scalable business working with kids in schools on sleep and play
- Currently stressed about income - her projects haven't generated much revenue lately
- Entrepreneurial but needs help packaging a scalable offer

## How I Can Support Her

- Help create a better, more scalable offer for schools
- Potential synergy with [[maxa]] - both targeting schools
- Be financially stable so she has breathing room to build
- Quality time together, not just coexisting while working

## Notes

- She's a great resource for sleep optimization (PhD-level knowledge!)
- Playful personality - this should come through in her product/brand

## Follow-ups
- [ ] Brainstorm session: What's her ideal scalable school offer?
- [ ] Explore Maxa + Frida school distribution synergy
