# Baby Prep / Nursery

**Why this is high priority:** Baby arrives late July 2026. That's 5 months. This zone needs to go from "doesn't exist yet" to "ready." The earlier you stage this, the less it competes with Maxa launch energy.

## Current State
<!-- What's the plan for where the baby will sleep/live? Is there a dedicated room or a corner of an existing room? What needs to move out to make space? -->


## Gear Checklist

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals for this zone:
- Everything reachable with one hand (you'll be holding a baby with the other)
- Diapers, wipes, change of clothes at arm's reach from changing spot
- Night feeding station: water, snacks, phone charger, dim light
- Frida's input is critical here — she's the sleep researcher

## Notes
