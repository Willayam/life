# Entryway / Hall

**Why this is high priority:** You pass through here multiple times a day. With Charlie's 50/50 schedule and daily preschool runs, this zone needs to be frictionless. Coats, shoes, keys, bags — everything needs a home so mornings don't burn willpower.

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals for this zone:
- "Launch pad" system: keys, wallet, phone charger, bag all in one spot
- Charlie's stuff at his height (coat, shoes, backpack)
- Seasonal rotation: only current-season outerwear visible
- Stroller/e-bike gear if applicable
- Inbox tray: one small container for things that need to be put away later

## Notes
<!-- Will the e-bike live here? Plan for helmet, lock, rain gear storage -->
