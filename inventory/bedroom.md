# Bedroom

**Goal:** Sleep sanctuary. Frida is a PhD sleep researcher — this room should be the gold standard for sleep hygiene. Nothing in here that doesn't support rest and intimacy.

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals:
- No screens (charge phones outside the room or across the room)
- Blackout curtains or blinds
- Temperature control (cool = better sleep)
- Clothes: daily rotation accessible, rest in closet
- Nightstands: minimal (book, water, lip balm — not a dumping ground)

## Notes
<!-- Ask Frida: what does the evidence say about optimal bedroom setup? She's literally the expert. -->
