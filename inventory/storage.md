# Storage / Closets

**Why this is high priority:** Baby #2 arrives July 2026. You need to make room — physically and mentally. Storage is where stuff goes to hide. Time to audit what's actually worth keeping.

## Current State
<!-- Walk through each closet/storage area. What's in there? When did you last open it? -->


## Items

| # | Item | Use Frequency | Decision | Action | Done |
|---|------|--------------|----------|--------|------|
| | | | | | [ ] |

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals for this zone:
- Clear out at least 30% of current storage for baby gear
- One shelf/area designated for seasonal items (ski gear, summer stuff)
- One memory box maximum for sentimental items
- Everything in labeled containers — no mystery bags
- If you haven't opened it in 12 months and it's not seasonal, it goes

## Notes
<!-- What baby gear do you already have from Charlie? What needs to be purchased? -->
