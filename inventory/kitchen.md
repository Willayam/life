# Kitchen

**Goal:** Support healthy eating (80 kg lean target) and hosting. Every counter item should be used daily or serve meal prep. Hidden clutter in cabinets = hidden decisions draining energy.

## Current State
<!-- Counters, cabinets, fridge, pantry — what's there? -->


## Items

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals:
- Counter: only daily-use items visible (coffee, cutting board, knife block)
- Cabinet near stove: cooking tools, oils, spices
- One cabinet for Charlie's plates/cups/snacks at his reach
- Pantry: protein-forward staples front and center (supports 80kg lean goal)
- Hosting supplies: accessible but not in daily-use zones
