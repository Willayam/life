# Inventory & Organization System

## Result
Every item I own earns its place. I can find anything in 30 seconds. My space is optimized for deep work, family life, and hosting — not storing stuff I don't use.

## Purpose
Physical clarity = mental clarity. Every minute spent looking for something or managing clutter is a minute stolen from Maxa, Frida, Charlie, and baby #2. With the baby arriving July 2026, this is the window to get the physical environment right.

## Massive Action Plan
Zone-by-zone inventory → decide what stays → organize and label → maintain with simple rules.

## How It Works

### 1. Zones (Not Categories)

Everything is organized by **physical location**, not by item type. This matches how you actually interact with your space — you go to a place, not to a category.

Each zone gets its own file in `inventory/`. A zone is any distinct area: a shelf, a drawer, a closet, a desk.

### 2. Photo-First Workflow

For each zone:
1. **Take a "before" photo** on your phone
2. **Drop it in** `inventory/photos/` (name it `ZONE-before.jpg`)
3. **List what's there** in the zone file
4. **Decide** on each item using the decision framework below
5. **Execute** — remove what goes, organize what stays
6. **Take an "after" photo** — `ZONE-after.jpg`
7. **Label** physical containers/shelves to match the zone file

### 3. The Decision Framework

For every item, ask in this order:

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Do I use this weekly? | **Keep — prime position** (arm's reach) | ↓ |
| Do I use this monthly? | **Keep — accessible** (same room, easy to reach) | ↓ |
| Do I use this seasonally/yearly? | **Keep — stored** (closet, storage) | ↓ |
| Does it directly serve a current goal? | **Keep — position for that goal** | ↓ |
| Does it have irreplaceable sentimental value? | **Keep — one dedicated memory box** | ↓ |
| None of the above? | — | **Remove** |

For items marked **Remove**:
- **Sell** — worth > 200 SEK and easy to sell (Blocket/Marketplace, list within 48h or donate)
- **Donate** — functional but not worth selling
- **Trash** — broken or worn out

### 4. Labeling System

Physical labels should match zone files. Use a label maker or tape + marker:
- **Shelf/drawer labels** — what belongs there (e.g., "Cables & Chargers", "Charlie — Art Supplies")
- **Container labels** — what's inside boxes/bins
- **"Home" labels** — for items that travel (e.g., label where the scissors *live*)

The rule: **if someone else couldn't find it in 30 seconds, it needs a label.**

### 5. Maintenance Rules

- **One in, one out** — bringing something new in? Something else leaves.
- **Weekly reset** — 15 min Sunday evening, put everything back in its labeled home.
- **Quarterly purge** — 1 hour per quarter, review zones for drift.
- **Inbox zone** — one small tray/box near the entrance for things that haven't found a home yet. Process it weekly.

## Zone Inventory

Status tracking for all zones. Update as you go.

| Zone | File | Status | Priority |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| Office/Desk | [office.md](office.md) | not started | high |
| Entryway/Hall | [entryway.md](entryway.md) | not started | high |
| Kitchen | [kitchen.md](kitchen.md) | not started | medium |
| Living Room | [living-room.md](living-room.md) | not started | medium |
| Bedroom | [bedroom.md](bedroom.md) | not started | medium |
| Bathroom | [bathroom.md](bathroom.md) | not started | low |
| Storage/Closets | [storage.md](storage.md) | not started | high |
| Charlie's Area | [charlies-area.md](charlies-area.md) | not started | medium |
| Baby Prep / Nursery | [nursery.md](nursery.md) | not started | high |

**Priority logic:**
- **High** = directly blocks goals (office → deep work, storage → making space for baby, nursery → baby prep, entryway → daily friction)
- **Medium** = quality of life improvement
- **Low** = functional enough for now

## Goal Alignment

Your stuff should serve your life categories:

| Life Category | What the physical space should support |
|---|---|
| **Maxa & Products** | Clean, focused desk. Fast access to devices. No visual clutter during deep work. |
| **Health & Energy** | Training gear accessible. Healthy food visible in kitchen. Sleep environment optimized. |
| **Frida & Family** | Hosting-ready living room. Charlie's stuff organized so he can self-serve. Baby gear staged. |
| **Consulting** | Same as Maxa — the office needs to work for calls, focus, and creation. |
| **Personal Brand** | Camera/recording setup accessible. Good lighting. Clean background for video. |

## Getting Started

**Don't boil the ocean.** Pick one zone, do it in 30-60 minutes, and move on. Momentum > perfection.

Suggested order:
1. **Office/Desk** — you're here every day, highest ROI on your focus
2. **Entryway** — you pass through it daily, sets the tone
3. **Storage/Closets** — make room for baby gear
4. **Nursery** — start staging for July
5. Everything else as energy allows

**First action:** Take your phone, photograph your desk area, and drop the photo here. We'll inventory it together.
