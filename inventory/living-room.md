# Living Room

**Goal:** Optimized for hosting friends, family time with Charlie, and relaxation. Should feel open and inviting, not cluttered. Also potential content recording space.

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals:
- Charlie's toys: contained system (one bin/shelf), rotate toys instead of displaying all
- Hosting-ready: surfaces clear, seating accessible
- Content corner: good lighting + clean background for recording
- Cozy but uncluttered
-->
