# Charlie's Area

**Goal:** A 4-year-old who can find his own stuff = fewer interruptions and more independence for him. Everything at his height. Simple categories he understands. Toy rotation instead of toy mountain.

## Current State
<!-- Where does Charlie's stuff live? One room? Spread across the apartment? -->


## Items

| # | Item | Use Frequency | Decision | Action | Done |

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals:
- Everything at Charlie's height so he can get and put away things himself
- Categories a 4-year-old understands: picture labels, color-coded bins
- Toy rotation: 10-15 toys out, rest stored. Swap every 2-3 weeks (feels like new toys)
- Art supplies: contained, wipe-clean surface
- Books: front-facing shelf so he can see covers
- "Put away" routine: make it a game, not a chore
-->


## Labels Needed
- [ ] Picture labels for bins (Charlie can't read yet — use images)

## Notes
<!-- Some of Charlie's gear will be reusable for baby #2 — track what can transition -->
