# Office / Desk

**Why this is priority #1:** This is where Maxa, Clarity, and Inkarnate work happens. Every item on or around the desk either supports deep work or distracts from it. This zone directly impacts your #1 and #2 bets.

## Current State
<!-- Take a photo and describe: What's on the desk? What's around it? What cables are visible? What's in the drawers? -->


## Items

| # | Item | Use Frequency | Decision | Action | Done |
|---|------|--------------|----------|--------|------|
| | | | | | [ ] |

## Organization Plan
<!-- Goals for this zone:
- Clear desk surface: only monitor, keyboard, mouse, and one personal item
- Cable management underneath
- Drawer 1: daily tools (pens, charger, headphones)
- Drawer 2: reference materials
- Nothing on desk that isn't used daily
- Clean background for video calls (content strategy)

## Labels Needed

## Notes
<!-- Consider: Do you need a second monitor? A standing desk converter? Better lighting for video? -->
