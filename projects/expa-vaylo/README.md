# Expa Vaylo

> Shared project documentation for the Expa Travel platform.

## What This Is

Central knowledge base for everyone working on the Expa Travel project. Architecture, integrations, custom code, known issues, and access — all in one place.

## Team

| Person | Role | Contact |
|---|---|---|
| **Erik Karlsson** | Project Lead (Vaylo) | <!-- TODO: add email --> |
| **William Larsten** | Original developer (transitioning out) | <!-- TODO: add email --> |
| **Catrine** | Expa NO | <!-- TODO: add email --> |
| **Bill Larsten** | Expa SE (exparesor.se) | bill@exparesor.se |

## Documentation

| Document | What's in it |
|---|---|
| [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) | System overview, Mermaid diagrams, how everything connects |
| [Framer](./docs/framer.md) | Website setup, CMS structure, custom code components |
| [BuildShip](./docs/buildship.md) | Backend workflows, data sync, debugging |
| [Access & Credentials](./docs/access.md) | Services, accounts, how to get access |
| [Open Issues](./docs/open-issues.md) | Known bugs, pending requests, open questions |

## Code

The [`/code`](./code/) directory is for committing Framer custom code components so they're version-controlled and reviewable outside of Framer.

## Projects

- **Expa NO** — <!-- TODO: URL, e.g. expa.no -->
