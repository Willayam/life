## Pipeline (Future Bets)

_Evaluate when bandwidth allows. Each should meet the [small bets criteria](../strategy/2026-bets.md)._

- [ ] Opportunities from [[michael]]'s network
- [ ] AI automation services (testing with dad's Expa SE work)
- [ ] Products born from consulting patterns (Inkarnate/Clarity insights)
- [ ] Content-driven products (once audience exists)

## Tagging Convention

All project files use frontmatter:

```yaml
---
status: active | winding-down | idea | paused
priority: 1-5
type: product | consulting | side-project
tags: [projects, ...]
---
```

Related content (brainstorms, suggestions, research) tags with `project: <name>` in frontmatter and links back with `[[project-name]]`.

To find everything for a project: search tag or use Obsidian's backlinks panel on the project file.
