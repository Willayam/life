## 1. Maxa (Högskoleprovet App)

**Result:** A launched, growing app with paying subscribers. The Duolingo of högskoleprovet.

**Purpose:** This is the primary vehicle to financial freedom. Recurring revenue that scales without my time.

**Status:** Pre-launch. Core app close. Blocked on finishing question extraction.

### What It Is
- Gamified test prep for högskoleprovet (Swedish university entrance exam)
- Fun, engaging, bite-sized practice (Duolingo-style)
- Mobile-first experience

### Business Model
- **Who pays:** Students preparing for högskoleprovet
- **Pricing (testing):**
  - Monthly: ~50-100 SEK/month
  - Yearly: TBD
  - Lifetime: ~1,000 SEK
- **Revenue math:**
  - 100 subscribers x 100 SEK = 10,000 SEK/month
  - 1,000 subscribers x 100 SEK = 100,000 SEK/month (replaces consulting!)
  - 10,000 subscribers x 100 SEK = 1,000,000 SEK/month

### Current Blockers
- [ ] **Question extraction** - Need to get all tests/questions into the system
- [ ] **Calculation algorithm** - Estimated score calculation needs to be correct

### Remaining Before Launch
- [ ] Finish question extraction (THE BLOCKER - days, not weeks)
- [ ] Fix calculation algorithm for estimated score
- [ ] Add gamification (fun sounds, engaging feel)
- [ ] Mascot from Pietro (contacted, need follow-up)
- [ ] Landing page (use [landing page framework](../landing-pages.md))
- [ ] **Play Store submission** - Get it to Olivia for testing ASAP
- [ ] App Store submission
- [ ] Payment/subscription integration

### Design & Quality
- [ ] Create custom Claude skill for design QA (current QA is terrible)
- [ ] Implement claymorphism on site and app

### First 10 Customers Plan
- [ ] Personal network - who is taking högskoleprovet?
- [ ] Find online communities (Reddit, Facebook groups, Discord)
- [ ] Schools / study groups
- [ ] Content marketing (build in public)

### Future Potential
- Could expand to nationella prov (high school tests) → Frida connection to schools
- International versions (SAT, etc.)

## 2. Inkarnate Consulting

**Result:** Stable 90K/month income for as long as I need it.

**Purpose:** This is the bridge. It pays the bills while I build Maxa. Do great work, but don't let it consume me.

**Status:** Active engagement. Currently blocked on their end (dev team fixing performance). UX demo on hold.

**Revenue:** 90,000 SEK/month (~$10K USD)

**Key contact:** (Inkarnate team)

### Ongoing
- [ ] Weekly check-ins with Inkarnate team
- [ ] Stay ready to demo UX improvements once perf stabilizes
- [ ] Track hours - keep this efficient, don't let it creep

### Boundary
Time-box consulting work. It should not expand to fill all available time. Target: focused blocks, not all-day availability.

---

## 3. Clarity.video

**Result:** New consulting engagement generating additional income.

**Purpose:** Additional revenue while building. Also builds portfolio and network.

**Status:** Drafting new risk-based proposal. Previous deeper proposal sent, now pivoting approach.

### Pricing Strategy (Feb 2026)
- **Approach:** Take the risk — revenue is low, so offer a profit-share model
- **Terms:** 50% profit share with a floor of $1,000/month
- **Scope:** More work than last summer. Max out design — glassmorphism, super clean UX
- **Positioning:** Upskill on design while delivering real value

### Next Steps
- [x] Write and send initial proposal
- [x] Received reply - they want deeper proposal
- [x] Write and send deeper proposal
- [ ] **Review what was done last summer** (scope, deliverables, pricing) for reference
- [ ] **Draft new risk-based proposal** — 50% profit, $1,000 floor, design-forward
- [ ] Send new proposal
- [ ] If accepted: scope the engagement, agree on terms

### Stripe Reporting
- [ ] Set up multi-reports: Stripe payments vs costs of running the service
  - Marcus costs = pulled from William personally
  - App running/dev costs (Claude, infra, etc.) = paid from company/app

## 4. Expa Travel (Winding Down)

**Result:** Clean exit. Minimal ongoing time investment. Maybe small income from dad's work.

**Purpose:** Don't let a dead project drain energy. Close it cleanly.

**Status:** Transitioning out. On-call paid support. Haven't been paid since October 2025.

### Key Facts
- Erik Karlsson (Strativ/Vaylo) taking over technical work
- Catrine needs to know if all changes go to Erik now
- You stopped receiving payment since October 2025

### Remaining Items
- [ ] Confirm handoff to Erik is complete
- [ ] Resolve any outstanding questions from Catrine
- [ ] Explore: AI automation / ads work for dad (Bill) at Expa SE - separate arrangement

### Open Questions from Expa NO (Feb 5 email)
1. Will mobile number be mandatory in next update?
2. Will email double-checking be added?
3. Will Expa logo be visible on the widget?
→ These should go to Erik now if handoff is complete.

## 5. Frida's School Offer

**Result:** Help Frida create a scalable product/offer she can sell to schools.

**Purpose:** Support my partner. Reduce her financial stress. Potentially synergize with Maxa.

**Status:** Idea stage.

**Concept:** Frida is a PhD sleep researcher who wants to work with kids in schools on sleep and play. Needs a scalable offer (not 1-on-1 consulting).

### Ideas
- Online course/program for schools
- App or digital tool
- Workshop-in-a-box that can be licensed
- [ ] Brainstorm session with Frida to define the offer

## 6. Building Projects (Queue)

_These are valuable but should not jump ahead of revenue-critical work._

- [ ] **Email classifier** - Build a classifier to zero out inbox
- [ ] **Framer/Vaylo replication** - Try replicating the Framer and Vaylo solution fully in code with agents
- [ ] **Expo meeting** - Book meeting for Thursday Feb 19 or Friday Feb 20

---

## Project Pipeline (Future Bets)

_Ideas to evaluate when bandwidth allows. Each should meet the small bets criteria._

- [ ] Opportunities from Michael's network
- [ ] AI automation services (testing with dad's Expa SE work)
- [ ] Products born from consulting patterns (Inkarnate/Clarity insights)
- [ ] Content-driven products (once audience exists)
