# Clarity.video

## Result
A profitable partnership where I own half the upside, drive costs down, and build a product that runs without me.

## Purpose
This is a consulting-to-ownership play. Not just billing hours - I want aligned incentives where improving the product and reducing costs directly benefits me. If I can clean up the stack, cut costs, and grow revenue, I should share in that value creation.

## Deal Structure (Proposed)

**Model:** 50/50 profit split with a minimum floor (whichever is higher)
- 50% of net profit (revenue minus all costs including dev)
- OR a minimum monthly retainer of $X (TBD)
- Dev costs come out of Clarity profits before split - keeps both sides fully aligned

**Why this works:**
- I'm incentivized to lower costs (my profit goes up)
- I'm incentivized to increase revenue (my profit goes up)
- Dev costs from profits means no one is writing checks - the business funds its own improvement
- Mikey gets a technical partner without upfront dev expense risk
