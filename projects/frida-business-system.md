# Frida Business System - Setup Session Plan

**Result:** Help Frida get a working business OS (like my Life OS) so she can sell courses, reach sports orgs, build her web presence, and create proposals — all with Claude Code as her execution layer.

**Purpose:** Reduce her stress about income. Give her a system that makes her feel in control. Support her without doing it for her — she needs to own it.

**When:** Schedule 3-4 hour block together. Bring coffee.

## What Frida Has

- PhD in sleep research (massive credibility)
- Experience working with kids in schools on sleep and play
- Entrepreneurial drive but no system to channel it
- Playful personality that should come through in everything
- Shared distribution opportunity with Maxa (both target schools)

## What She Needs

1. A repo/vault like this one — her own command center
2. Claude Code set up so she can work with AI daily
3. Clear offers she can sell (not vague "I do sleep stuff")
4. A pipeline for reaching sports orgs and schools
5. A website that converts
6. Proposal templates she can fire off quickly
7. A way to track what's working and what isn't

## Session Agenda

### Part 1: Foundation (45 min)

**Get the system running:**

- [ ] Create GitHub account (or use existing)
- [ ] Set up her repo (e.g. `frida-business/` or `frida-life/`)
- [ ] Install Claude Code on her machine
- [ ] Create her `CLAUDE.md` with her context, goals, and how Claude should help her
- [ ] Set up basic folder structure:

```
frida-business/
  CLAUDE.md              # Her system instructions
  overview.md            # Business vision and goals

  offers/                # Her packaged services
    courses.md           # Course catalog and pricing
    workshops.md         # Workshop packages
    consulting.md        # 1-on-1 or group consulting

  outreach/              # Sales pipeline
    sports-orgs.md       # Target sports organizations list
    schools.md           # Target schools list
    templates/           # Email/message templates
    log.md               # Outreach tracker (who, when, result)

  proposals/             # Proposal templates and sent proposals
    template.md          # Base proposal template

  website/               # Website content and copy
    homepage.md          # Landing page copy
    about.md             # About page

  content/               # Course content and materials
  finances/              # Revenue tracking, pricing decisions
  daily/                 # Brain dumps, session notes
  people/                # Her CRM - contacts at orgs, leads
```

### Part 2: Define Her Offers (60 min)

**This is the most important part. She needs to leave with clear, sellable offers.**

Key questions to work through together:

1. **Who exactly is the buyer?**
   - School principals? Teachers? Sports club directors? Parents?
   - Who has budget and authority to say yes?

2. **What's the transformation she delivers?**
   - Not "I teach about sleep" but "Your athletes recover faster and perform better" or "Your students focus better and behavioral issues drop"
   - Frame it as outcomes, not activities

3. **What are her offer tiers?** (suggest 3 tiers)
   - **Starter:** Digital course / self-paced program (scalable, low touch)
   - **Standard:** Live workshop series (higher value, moderate touch)
   - **Premium:** Full program with follow-up coaching (highest value, limited spots)

4. **Pricing:**
   - Research what schools/sports orgs pay for similar programs
   - Don't underprice — PhD credibility commands premium
   - Think per-school or per-organization, not per-person

5. **What makes her different?**
   - PhD researcher (not just another wellness coach)
   - Playful approach (kids actually enjoy it)
   - Evidence-based (can show data and results)

### Part 3: Outreach System (45 min)

**Build the pipeline for reaching sports orgs and schools:**

- [ ] Brainstorm target list: which sports organizations? (SIF? RF? Individual clubs?)
- [ ] Brainstorm target list: which schools/municipalities?
- [ ] Create outreach email templates (cold intro, follow-up, proposal attached)
- [ ] Set up tracking in `outreach/log.md`
- [ ] Draft 3 versions of cold outreach:
  - To sports org decision makers
  - To school principals/administrators
  - To municipality education departments

**Outreach log format:**

```markdown
| Date | Org | Contact | Channel | Status | Follow-up |
|------|-----|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| 2026-03-01 | Djurgårdens IF | Anna S. | Email | Sent | Follow up Mar 8 |
```

### Part 4: Website & Proposals (45 min)

**Website — keep it simple, one clear page to start:**

- Use Hormozi landing page framework (see [[landing-pages-hormozi]])
- Headline: Clear outcome promise
- Sub-headline: How she delivers it
- 3 bullet points addressing objections
- CTA: Book a call / Request proposal
- Social proof: PhD, any testimonials, results data
- Could use Framer, Squarespace, or even a simple one-pager to start

**Proposal template:**

- [ ] Create a reusable proposal template with:
  - Problem statement (tailored to their org)
  - Proposed solution (which offer tier)
  - Expected outcomes (specific, measurable)
  - About Frida (credibility: PhD, experience)
  - Investment (pricing)
  - Next steps
- [ ] Make it easy to customize per org (fill-in-the-blanks sections)

## Key Decisions to Make During Session

These are the forks in the road — need her input:

1. **Repo scope:** Business-only repo or full life OS like mine?
2. **Primary target:** Sports orgs first or schools first? (Pick one to start)
3. **Lead offer:** Which tier to push first? (Probably workshops — higher perceived value than digital, easier to sell than premium)
4. **Website tool:** Framer? Squarespace? Code it? (Framer probably fastest for her)
5. **Language:** Swedish site + Swedish outreach? Or bilingual from the start?
6. **Brand name:** Under her own name? Or a business name?
7. **Claude Code skills:** Set up Gmail skill for her too? Calendar?

---

## Things to Prep Before the Session

- [ ] Have a Claude Code invite/access ready for her
- [ ] Have the GitHub repo created (or be ready to create it together)
- [ ] Print/save the Hormozi landing page framework
- [ ] Look up 2-3 examples of similar offers (sleep programs for schools/sports) for inspiration and pricing benchmarks
- [ ] Have her think about: "What are the 3 organizations you'd most want to work with?"
- [ ] Schedule the session on the calendar

---

## Synergies with Maxa

Don't forget — there's a real distribution play here:

- Maxa targets schools → Frida targets schools
- Shared contact lists and relationships
- Bundle potential: "Maxa for test prep + Frida's program for student wellbeing"
- Her credibility (PhD) adds weight to both
- If Maxa gets into schools, warm intro for Frida's offer and vice versa

---

## Success Criteria

After the session, Frida should have:

- [x] A working repo with Claude Code she can use independently
- [x] Clear, defined offers with pricing guidance
- [x] A target list of 10-20 organizations to reach out to
- [x] Email templates ready to send
- [x] A proposal template she can customize
- [x] Website copy drafted (even if not live yet)
- [x] Confidence that she has a system, not just ideas

The goal isn't perfection — it's momentum. She should be able to send her first outreach email the day after.
