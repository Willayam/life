# Maxa: 10-Day Ship Plan

**Hard deadline: In the App Store by Friday March 7, 2026.**

Tell 5 people this date today. Olivia, Frida, one friend, your dad, one person from your network who's taking the test. Make it real.

## What "Shipped" Means

- App is downloadable from the App Store
- A user can sign up, pick a test, take it, see their score
- 4 practice tests work end-to-end with correct answers
- Payment/subscription can come in a fast-follow update — launch free with limited tests first if needed

## What "Shipped" Does NOT Mean

- ~~Perfect calculation algorithm~~ — good enough is fine, iterate later
- ~~Mascot from Pietro~~ — icebox
- ~~Claymorphism~~ — icebox
- ~~AppMap design QA tool~~ — icebox
- ~~Gamification sounds~~ — icebox
- ~~Landing page~~ — App Store listing IS the landing page for now

## Day-by-Day Plan

### Day 1 — Wed Feb 26
**Morning block (09:00-12:00): Question extraction finish line**
- [ ] Audit: How many tests are extracted? Which ones are incomplete?
- [ ] Identify the minimum 4 tests needed for launch
- [ ] Fix extraction errors on those 4 tests ONLY — ignore the rest

### Day 2 — Thu Feb 27
_Charlie day + mountains. Light work only._
- [ ] If any test fixes are straightforward, do 1 hour in the morning
- [ ] Otherwise: rest day. Be present.

### Day 3 — Fri Feb 28
**Full ship day (nap time / evening if Charlie)**
- [ ] Complete question extraction for 4 launch tests
- [ ] End-to-end test all 4 on web AND app
- [ ] Fix any broken questions/answers found during testing
- [ ] Definition of done: You can take all 4 tests start-to-finish, every question renders, answers are correct

### Day 4 — Sat Mar 1
- [ ] If 4 tests are solid: move to App Store prep
- [ ] If not: this is your overflow day for test QA
- [ ] App Store metadata: write description, pick keywords, take screenshots
- [ ] Do NOT rabbit-hole on screenshot design — phone frames, real app, done

### Day 5 — Sun Mar 2
- [ ] Weekly review (fill in time tracking + end of week review — ACTUALLY DO IT)
- [ ] App Store submission prep: ensure build compiles, no crashes, submission checklist complete

### Day 6 — Mon Mar 3
**Full ship day**
- [ ] Fix calculation algorithm to "good enough" (not perfect — users care about practice, not decimal precision)
- [ ] Final full QA pass: sign up flow → test selection → take test → see score
- [ ] Submit to App Store

### Day 7 — Tue Mar 4
- [ ] If submission rejected: fix issues immediately, resubmit same day
- [ ] If submitted: work on Inkarnate (this is your Inkarnate day)
- [ ] Start telling people: "Maxa is coming this week"

### Day 8-9 — Wed-Thu Mar 5-6
- [ ] Handle any App Store review feedback
- [ ] Prepare "first 10 users" outreach list: who do you know taking högskoleprovet?
- [ ] Post in relevant communities (Reddit, Facebook groups)
- [ ] If approved: celebrate. You shipped.

### Day 10 — Fri Mar 7
**DEADLINE. Maxa is either in the store or you know exactly why not.**
- [ ] If live: send to 10 people. Get feedback. This is day 1 of the business.
- [ ] If not: document exactly what blocked it and make a decision about the path forward.

## The Anti-Distraction Contract

For these 10 days:
- No researching new tools or ideas (Heaper, Mortality Map, etc.)
- No building email classifiers or other side projects
- No Framer/Vaylo replication experiments
- No claymorphism or design polish
- No content strategy planning
- If a new idea comes up: 30 seconds to write it in the [Icebox](../strategy/icebox.md), then back to work
- Inkarnate gets its time-boxed hours and NOTHING MORE
