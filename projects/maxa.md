# Maxa (Högskoleprovet App)

**Result:** A launched, growing app with paying subscribers. The Duolingo of högskoleprovet.

**Purpose:** This is the primary vehicle to financial freedom. Recurring revenue that scales without my time.

**Status:** Pre-launch. Core app close. Blocked on finishing question extraction.

## What It Is

- Gamified test prep for högskoleprovet (Swedish university entrance exam)
- Fun, engaging, bite-sized practice (Duolingo-style)
- Mobile-first experience

## Business Model

- **Who pays:** Students preparing for högskoleprovet
- **Pricing (testing):**
  - Monthly: ~50-100 SEK/month
  - Yearly: TBD
  - Lifetime: ~1,000 SEK
- **Revenue math:**
  - 100 subscribers x 100 SEK = 10,000 SEK/month
  - 1,000 subscribers x 100 SEK = 100,000 SEK/month (replaces consulting!)
  - 10,000 subscribers x 100 SEK = 1,000,000 SEK/month

## Current Blockers

- [ ] **Question extraction** - Need to get all tests/questions into the system
- [ ] **Calculation algorithm** - Estimated score calculation needs to be correct

## Remaining Before Launch

- [ ] Finish question extraction (THE BLOCKER - days, not weeks)
- [ ] Fix calculation algorithm for estimated score
- [ ] Add gamification (fun sounds, engaging feel)
- [ ] Mascot from Pietro (contacted, need follow-up)
- [ ] Landing page (use [[landing-pages-hormozi]])
- [ ] App Store / distribution setup
- [ ] Payment/subscription integration

## First 10 Customers Plan

- [ ] Personal network - who is taking högskoleprovet?
- [ ] Find online communities (Reddit, Facebook groups, Discord)
- [ ] Schools / study groups
- [ ] Content marketing (build in public)

## Future Potential

- Could expand to nationella prov (high school tests) → [[frida]] connection to schools
- International versions (SAT, etc.)
