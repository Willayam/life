# Inkarnate Consulting

**Result:** Stable 90K/month income for as long as I need it.

**Purpose:** This is the bridge. It pays the bills while I build [[maxa]]. Do great work, but don't let it consume me.

**Status:** Active engagement. Currently blocked on their end (dev team fixing performance). UX demo on hold.

**Revenue:** 90,000 SEK/month (~$10K USD)

**Key contact:** Ingmar (Inkarnate team)

## Ongoing

- [ ] Weekly check-ins with Inkarnate team
- [ ] Stay ready to demo UX improvements once perf stabilizes
- [ ] Track hours - keep this efficient, don't let it creep

## Boundary

Time-box consulting work. It should not expand to fill all available time. Target: focused blocks, not all-day availability.
