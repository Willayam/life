# Frida's School Offer

**Result:** Help [[frida]] create a scalable product/offer she can sell to schools.

**Purpose:** Support my partner. Reduce her financial stress. Potentially synergize with [[maxa]].

**Status:** Idea stage.

**Concept:** Frida is a PhD sleep researcher who wants to work with kids in schools on sleep and play. Needs a scalable offer (not 1-on-1 consulting).
