## 1. Purpose

This Agreement formalizes the partnership between William and Clarity for the ongoing product development, security remediation, and growth of the Clarity.video platform (the "Platform"). The structure aligns incentives: both parties win only when the Platform wins.

---

## 2. Scope of Work

William shall serve as the product and technology lead for the Platform, responsible for:

1. **Security remediation** — Rotating exposed credentials, moving all keys server-side, implementing error tracking
2. **Platform rebuild** — Strangler pattern migration of legacy systems, improving core flows (video recording, page building, onboarding)
3. **AI-powered features** — Meeting-to-proposal automation, calendar integration, AI page generation
4. **Analytics and growth** — Funnel instrumentation, retention improvements, monthly reporting
5. **Special projects** — Business Mastery booth preparation, testimonial platform, and other mutually agreed initiatives

Changes to this scope require written agreement of both Parties. If Clarity requests work materially outside this scope, William may (a) decline, (b) agree under existing terms, or (c) negotiate additional compensation.

## 3. Revenue Share

### 3.1 Profit Split

The Parties shall share Net Profit from the Platform on a 50/50 basis.

### 3.2 Definitions

**Gross Revenue.** All revenue received by Clarity directly attributable to the Platform, including subscription fees, usage fees, implementation fees, one-time charges, and any other amounts paid by customers for access to or use of the Platform.

**Permitted Deductions.** The following are the sole permitted deductions from Gross Revenue:

(a) Payment processing fees (e.g., Stripe) actually incurred;
(b) Refunds and chargebacks actually issued to customers;
(c) Sales taxes, VAT, or other government-imposed transaction taxes actually remitted;
(d) Third-party hosting and infrastructure costs (e.g., AWS, cloud services) directly attributable to the Platform;
(e) Third-party SaaS tools and API costs directly integrated into the Platform and agreed upon by both Parties in writing;
(f) Development resources engaged by William (e.g., contractors, AI tools) for Platform work.

**Net Profit.** Gross Revenue minus Permitted Deductions.

### 3.3 Minimum Monthly Payment

Regardless of Net Profit in any given month, Clarity shall pay William a minimum of USD $1,000 per month (the "Floor Payment"). If William's Profit Share for any month exceeds the Floor Payment, William shall receive the Profit Share amount. The Floor Payment is not an advance against future Profit Share; it is a minimum guarantee.

### 3.4 Payment Terms

William's Profit Share shall be paid within fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar month via wire transfer or other mutually agreed method. William shall invoice Clarity monthly.

### 4.2 Platform Access

During the term, William shall have full access to the Platform's codebase, analytics, billing systems (including Stripe dashboard), and relevant customer data necessary to perform his obligations and verify revenue reports.

### 4.3 Audit Rights

William shall have the right, at his own expense (except as provided below), to audit or have audited by an independent certified public accountant the financial records of Clarity related to the Platform, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice, no more than once per calendar year.

If any audit reveals an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) for any audited period, Clarity shall (a) promptly pay the deficiency plus interest at 8% per annum from the date originally due, and (b) reimburse William for the reasonable costs of the audit.
