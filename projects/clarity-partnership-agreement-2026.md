## 1. Purpose

This Agreement formalizes the partnership between William and Clarity for the ongoing product development, security remediation, and growth of the Clarity Video platform (the "Platform"). The structure aligns incentives: both parties win only when the Platform wins.

---

## 2. Scope of Work

William shall serve as the product and technology lead for the Platform, responsible for:

1. **Security remediation** — Rotating exposed credentials, moving all keys server-side, implementing error tracking
2. **Platform rebuild** — Strangler pattern migration of legacy systems, improving core flows (video recording, page building, onboarding)
3. **AI-powered features** — Meeting-to-proposal automation, calendar integration, AI page generation
4. **Analytics and growth** — Funnel instrumentation, retention improvements, monthly reporting
5. **Special projects** — Business Mastery booth preparation, testimonial platform, and other mutually agreed initiatives

Changes to this scope require written agreement of both Parties. If Clarity requests work materially outside this scope, William may (a) decline, (b) agree under existing terms, or (c) negotiate additional compensation.

## 3. Revenue Share

### 3.1 Profit Split

The Parties shall share Net Profit from the Platform on a 50/50 basis.

### 3.2 Definitions

**Gross Revenue.** The total amount of Stripe payouts received by Clarity from the Platform during a calendar month. Stripe payouts are net of Stripe's own processing fees, refunds, and chargebacks.

**Permitted Deductions.** The following are the sole permitted deductions from Gross Revenue:

(a) Third-party hosting and infrastructure costs (e.g., AWS, cloud services) directly attributable to the Platform;
(b) Third-party SaaS tools and API costs directly integrated into the Platform and agreed upon by both Parties in writing;
(c) Development resources engaged by William (e.g., contractors, AI tools) for Platform work.

**Excluded Costs.** The following shall NOT be deducted from Gross Revenue:

(a) Clarity's general overhead, salaries, rent, or administrative expenses;
(b) Sales, marketing, or advertising costs unless mutually agreed in writing in advance;
(c) Todd's compensation, travel, or personal expenses;
(d) Legal or accounting fees;
(e) Any costs not listed in Permitted Deductions above.

**Net Profit.** Gross Revenue minus Permitted Deductions.

### 3.3 Minimum Monthly Payment

Regardless of Net Profit in any given month, Clarity shall pay William a minimum of USD $1,000 per month (the "Floor Payment"). If William's Profit Share for any month exceeds the Floor Payment, William shall receive the Profit Share amount. The Floor Payment is not an advance against future Profit Share; it is a minimum guarantee.

### 3.4 Payment Process

All invoices are payable within ten (10) business days of receipt via wire transfer or other mutually agreed method.

Each month has two components:

1. **Floor invoice.** At the beginning of each month, William shall invoice Clarity for the Floor Payment of USD $1,000.
2. **Reconciliation invoice.** Within five (5) business days after the end of each calendar month, William shall prepare a report containing: (i) Stripe payouts for that month, (ii) Permitted Deductions with supporting documentation, (iii) calculated Net Profit, and (iv) William's Profit Share. If the Profit Share exceeds the Floor Payment already invoiced, William shall invoice Clarity for the difference.

### 3.5 Late Payments

Any amount not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, calculated from the date such payment was due until the date of actual payment.

---

## 4. Clarity's Responsibilities

Clarity shall:

(a) Provide William with timely access to the Platform's codebase, hosting environments, third-party service accounts, analytics, billing systems (including Stripe dashboard), and all other systems and data reasonably necessary for William to perform his obligations;

(b) Provide timely feedback, decisions, and approvals as reasonably required for the progress of the work;

(c) Designate a primary point of contact to coordinate with William;

(d) Not restrict or revoke any access described above without thirty (30) days' prior written notice and mutual agreement.

Delays caused by Clarity's failure to fulfill its responsibilities under this Section shall not constitute a breach by William and shall extend any applicable deadlines by the duration of such delay.

---

## 5. Reporting and Transparency

### 5.1 Monthly Reports

William shall prepare the monthly report as described in Section 3.4. Clarity shall ensure William has timely access to all Stripe payout data and Platform cost records needed to compile the report. Either Party may dispute any item in the report within fifteen (15) days of delivery, and the Parties shall resolve any disputes in good faith.

### 5.2 Audit Rights

William shall have the right, at his own expense (except as provided below), to audit or have audited by an independent certified public accountant the financial records of Clarity related to the Platform, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice, no more than once per calendar year.

If any audit reveals an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) for any audited period, Clarity shall (a) promptly pay the deficiency plus interest at 8% per annum from the date originally due, and (b) reimburse William for the reasonable costs of the audit.

---

## 6. Term and Termination

This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for an initial Trial Period of three (3) months. During the Trial Period, either Party may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice.

(a) commits a material breach that remains uncured for thirty (30) days after written notice;
(b) becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors;
(c) engages in fraud, willful misconduct, or gross negligence that materially harms the other Party or the Platform.

### 6.4 Post-Termination Revenue Share (Tail Provision)

Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, William shall continue to receive his Profit Share percentage (50%) of Net Profit from the Platform for a period of six (6) months following the effective date of termination (the "Tail Period").

During the Tail Period, Clarity shall continue to provide monthly revenue reports in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement, and all audit rights shall remain in effect.

### 6.5 Effect of Termination Type

- If Clarity terminates for convenience or William terminates for cause: the Post-Termination Revenue Share (Section 6.4) shall apply in full.
- If William terminates for convenience: the Post-Termination Revenue Share shall apply in full.
- If Clarity terminates for cause due to William's material breach: no Post-Termination Revenue Share shall be owed.
