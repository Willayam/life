# Life Overview

## Who I Am

William Larsten. Product person turned AI-augmented builder. Based in Stockholm.

**Core identity:** Connector-builder. I synthesize high-level strategic thinking with ground-level product craft. I thrive orchestrating people, ideas, and tools - not grinding solo on repetitive execution.

**Unfair advantages:**
- Product intuition + holistic thinking (rare combo of strategic and tactical)
- Deep network from Tony Robbins Platinum Partnership and life experience
- AI-augmented builder - a product person who can now ship without a full team
- Relatable communicator with natural content instincts
- Voracious learner (1000+ books, constant pattern recognition)

**Where I struggle:** Finishing > starting. Consistency when working alone. Spreading across too many things. Need external accountability and collaborative energy.

## Current Strategic Focus (Feb-Jul 2026)

**The mission is clear:** Get to financial independence through leveraged products, starting with Maxa. Protect consulting income. Optimize for parental leave. Stay healthy and present.

Three things that would make 2026 a defining year:
1. **Maxa generating meaningful recurring revenue** (product-market fit + growth)
2. **Parental leave maximized** (salary optimization done right)
3. **One or more additional products/income streams** that don't require my time
