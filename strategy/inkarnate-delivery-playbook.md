# Inkarnate: High-Value Delivery Playbook

## The System

One delivery cycle per week. Every cycle produces something Ingmar can see, react to, and feel momentum from — without you needing to be "on call."

---

## Weekly Delivery Cycle

### Monday or Tuesday — Build Day (4-6 hours)

This is your ONE Inkarnate deep work block for the week. No meetings. No Discord. Just output.

**What you produce:**
- A prototype, design direction, or strategic document
- For design/UX work: 2-3 options (not one). Options make the client feel in control and make you look like you've explored the space.
- For strategy work: a clear recommendation with rationale

### Tuesday or Wednesday — The Weekly Video (20-30 min to record)

Record a short Loom/screen recording (3-7 minutes) walking Ingmar through what you built. Structure it the same way every time:

**Video Template:**

> "Hey Ingmar, here's this week's update on [workstream]."
>
> **1. What I did** (30 sec)
> Quick summary. "This week I focused on the map creation flow. Specifically the new user onboarding into the editor."
>
> **2. What I'm showing you** (2-4 min)
> Walk through the prototype / designs / options. Screen share. Click through it. Show, don't tell.
>
> If options: "I explored three directions. Option A optimizes for speed — one click and you're in the editor. Option B gives a guided path — the user picks a style first. Option C is a hybrid. Here's the tradeoff..."
>
> **3. My recommendation** (30 sec)
> "I'd go with Option B because [reason]. But I want your gut reaction."
>
> **4. What I need from you** (15 sec)
> One clear ask. "Watch this, pick a direction, and drop me a message. I'll build it out next week."
>
> **5. What's next** (15 sec)
> "Next week I'm moving to [next thing]. If there's anything you'd rather I prioritize, let me know."

Send the video via Discord/Slack/email — wherever Ingmar checks. No meeting needed.

### Wednesday-Thursday — Response Window

Ingmar reacts. You answer questions async. This is your "available for follow-up" window — but it's bounded. A few messages, maybe a 15-min call if needed. Not all-day availability.

### Friday — Nothing

Inkarnate is done for the week. You've delivered, communicated, and responded. Maxa gets Friday.

## The Workstream Rotation

You have 4 active workstreams. Don't try to advance all 4 every week. Rotate:

| Week | Primary Focus | Video Shows |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| W1 | Map creation flow | 2-3 prototype directions for the new creation UX |
| W2 | Editor changes | Cleaned-up navbar + merged panels prototype |
| W3 | Performance strategy | Strategic doc + benchmark data + recommended approach |
| W4 | Landing page | 2-3 landing page concepts with messaging variations |
| W5 | Map creation flow (iteration based on W1 feedback) | Refined direction + next layer of detail |

This gives Ingmar:
- Visible progress every single week
- A clear sense that all workstreams are moving
- Time to process and react before the next iteration
- No weeks where he wonders "what is William doing?"

---

## Why This Works Better Than "Showing Up"

| Showing up | Weekly delivery |
|-----------|----------------|
| "William was on Discord today" | "William sent me 3 options for the map flow" |
| Value is invisible | Value is a video I can rewatch and share with my team |
| Client wonders what you're doing | Client sees exactly what you did |
| Hours feel like the product | Outcomes feel like the product |
| Hard to justify a rate increase | Easy to point to a trail of delivered value |

**The key insight:** Ingmar doesn't need you available. He needs to feel forward motion. A 5-minute video showing a working prototype creates more confidence than 8 hours of being "around."

---

## The Options Framework

For design/UX deliveries, always present 2-3 options. Here's why:

1. **One option = "take it or leave it."** Client feels trapped. Often says "I don't know, let me think about it" (stalls).
2. **Two options = "this or that."** Better. But often becomes a debate.
3. **Three options = "choose your adventure."** Client feels empowered. Usually picks one quickly or combines elements. You look thorough.

**How to structure options efficiently:**
- Option A: The safe, incremental version (what they'd expect)
- Option B: Your actual recommendation (the bold move)
- Option C: The ambitious stretch (shows you're thinking bigger than they asked)

You don't need to fully build 3 things. Often it's:
- One working prototype (Option B, your recommendation)
- Two quick mockups or annotated screenshots (Options A and C)
- Total extra time for options: 30-60 minutes

The perceived value of 3 options is 5x the perceived value of 1 — for maybe 20% more work.

## How to Introduce This to Ingmar

You don't need permission to operate this way. Just start doing it. But if you want to frame it:

> "Hey Ingmar — I want to make our collaboration more efficient for both of us. I'm going to start sending you a weekly video walkthrough of what I've built that week, with options for you to react to. This way you can watch it on your time, share it with the team, and we save meeting time for the decisions that actually need discussion. I'll always include a clear recommendation and what I need from you. Sound good?"

He will say yes. No CEO has ever said "no, I'd prefer you to just be vaguely available."

## Tracking: The Value Ledger

After each weekly delivery, log it here:

| Week | Workstream | What I Delivered | Ingmar's Reaction |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| W09 | Map creation flow | Nav + card UI prototype | |
| W10 | | | |
| W11 | | | |
| W12 | | | |

This becomes your evidence for the rate conversation in Q2.
