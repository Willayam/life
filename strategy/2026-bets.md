# 2026 Strategy: Small Bets

## Core Philosophy

Place many small bets that:
- Have potential to 10x revenue (or more)
- Are **not** tied to working hours (scalable/passive)
- Create high leverage through software and automation
- Can fail cheaply but win big

## Why Small Bets?

- Diversified risk across multiple opportunities
- Learn fast from each attempt
- Don't need every bet to win - just need a few to hit
- Each bet builds skills and assets for the next

## Current Bets (Ranked by Priority)

### 1. Maxa (Högskoleprovet App) ← PRIMARY BET
- Duolingo-style gamified test prep for Swedish university entrance exam
- **Potential:** Recurring revenue per student. 1,000 subs = replaces consulting.
- **Status:** Pre-launch, finishing question extraction
- **Details:** [projects/active.md](../projects/active.md)

### 2. Content & Personal Brand
- Build audience → distribution for everything else
- **Potential:** Audience is the ultimate multiplier for all other bets
- **Status:** Not started yet. Planning phase.
- **Details:** [strategy/content.md](content.md)

### 3. Consulting → Productization
- Inkarnate (active, 90K/month), Clarity.video (proposal sent)
- Look for patterns that could become products
- **Potential:** Insights from consulting become standalone products

### 4. Frida's School Offer
- PhD sleep researcher + playful kids programs → scalable school product
- **Potential:** Shared distribution channel with Maxa (both target schools)
- **Status:** Idea stage

### 5. AI Automation Services
- Testing with dad's Expa SE work
- Via Michael's network and projects
- **Potential:** Find repeatable problems worth solving with software

## Criteria for New Bets

- Can I build an MVP in days/weeks, not months?
- Is there a clear path to revenue?
- Can it grow without proportional time investment?
- Does it leverage my existing skills?
- **NEW: Does it conflict with shipping Maxa?** (If yes, defer it.)

## Pipeline

_Ideas and opportunities to evaluate when Maxa is launched_

- [x] Opportunities from Michael meeting
- [ ] AI automation products from consulting patterns
- [ ] International expansion of Maxa (SAT, other entrance exams)
- [ ] Nationella prov expansion (high school tests - Frida synergy)
