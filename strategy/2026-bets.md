# 2026 Strategy: Small Bets

## Core Philosophy

Place many small bets that:
- Have potential to 10x revenue (or more)
- Are **not** tied to working hours (scalable/passive)
- Create high leverage through software and automation
- Can fail cheaply but win big

## Why Small Bets?

- Diversified risk across multiple opportunities
- Learn fast from each attempt
- Don't need every bet to win - just need a few to hit
- Each bet builds skills and assets for the next

## Current Bets

### Maxa (Hub School App)
- School-approved app with gamified learning
- Potential: Recurring revenue per school/student

### Consulting → Productization
- Inkarnate, Clarity.video engagements
- Look for patterns that could become products

### Custom Software Opportunities
- Via Michael's network and projects
- Find problems worth solving with software

## Criteria for New Bets

- Can I build an MVP in days/weeks, not months?
- Is there a clear path to revenue?
- Can it grow without proportional time investment?
- Does it leverage my existing skills?

## Pipeline
