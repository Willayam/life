# Inkarnate: From Scarcity to Outcome-Based Value

## The Fear

"I need to show up or I'll get kicked off."

This fear is doing three things to you:

1. **It makes you sell presence instead of outcomes.** You feel like you need to be "available" — responsive on Discord, visible in meetings, looking busy. But Inkarnate isn't paying 90K/month for your availability. They're paying for the map creation flow overhaul, the editor redesign, the performance strategy. Those are outcomes. If you deliver a brilliant map creation flow prototype in 15 focused hours, that's worth more than 40 hours of showing up.

2. **It prevents you from raising your rate.** If you believe you're at risk of being fired, you won't ask for more money. You'll play small. You'll over-deliver on hours to justify the current rate rather than raising the rate by increasing the value of what you deliver.

3. **It bleeds into Maxa time.** The anxiety of "am I showing up enough" means Inkarnate occupies mental space far beyond its actual hours. It becomes background noise on days you should be fully in Maxa mode.

## The Reality Check

Ask yourself honestly:

- Have they ever threatened to end the engagement?
- Have they expressed dissatisfaction with your work?
- Or is this fear coming from inside — from a pattern of feeling like you need to earn your place?

If Inkarnate is happy with what you're delivering (and the expanding scope — performance strategy, landing page, map creation flow — suggests they are), then the fear is unfounded. You're projecting.

## The Reframe

**Old frame:** "I need to show up X hours so they don't fire me."
**New frame:** "I deliver outcomes worth 3x what they pay me. Here's the proof."

### How to Operate in the New Frame

**1. Track and communicate outcomes, not hours.**
Instead of being "available," send a weekly async update:
- "This week I delivered: [prototype / strategy doc / design direction]"
- "Next week I'm focused on: [specific outcome]"
- "Decision I need from you: [one thing]"

This does two things: it makes your value visible AND it means you don't need to perform availability. They see results, not Slack green dots.

**2. Set a consulting rhythm that protects Maxa.**
- **2 focused Inkarnate days per week** (e.g., Tuesday + Wednesday morning)
- **Inkarnate meetings: consolidated into those days**
- **Other days: Maxa. Phone on silent. Discord closed.**
- Tell Inkarnate this proactively: "I've structured my week to give you my best focused work on [days]. I'll be deep in other projects the rest of the week but will always deliver what we agreed to."

Professional consultants do this. It's not risky — it's how high-value people operate. They'll respect it more than constant availability.

**3. Prepare the rate conversation.**
When (not if) you raise your rate, the conversation is:
- "Over the past [X months], the scope has grown from [original] to now include performance strategy, landing page, and the full map creation flow overhaul."
- "I want to continue delivering this level of work. Given the expanded scope, I'd like to adjust our rate to [120K SEK/month]."
- Have this conversation in Q2 2026, once the map creation flow ships and the value is undeniable.

**4. Build a "value ledger."**
Keep a running list of outcomes you've delivered for Inkarnate. Every prototype, every strategy insight, every UX improvement. When scarcity thoughts come up, look at the ledger. When the rate conversation comes, bring the ledger.

## The Deeper Pattern

This fear — "I need to prove I deserve to be here" — likely isn't just about Inkarnate. It probably shows up in other areas too. It's worth noticing when it appears and asking: "Am I reacting to reality, or am I reacting to a story about reality?"

You don't need to fix this completely. You just need to see it clearly enough that it stops driving your behavior. The behavior change is: **deliver outcomes, communicate them, protect your time, and trust that your work speaks for itself.**
