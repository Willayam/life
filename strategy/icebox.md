_Ideas worth remembering. Not worth acting on right now. Review monthly._

**Rule:** Adding an idea here takes 30 seconds. No research. No links. No "next steps." Just the name and one sentence. If it still excites you when you review it monthly, promote it.

## Product Ideas
- **Email classifier** — Build a classifier to zero out inbox automatically
- **Mortality Map** — Interactive open-source visualization: causes of death, mechanisms, trainable prevention actions. Built on real study data.

## Infrastructure / Tools
- **Heaper** — Local-first digital workspace, possible Obsidian alternative or complement
