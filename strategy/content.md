# Personal Brand & Content Strategy

## Result
Growing audience on path to 1M+ followers in 3 years. Authentic, relaxed content creation. Distribution channel for products.

## Purpose
A personal brand is the ultimate leverage multiplier. It makes everything else easier - product launches, partnerships, opportunities coming to you. And it's creative expression on my own terms.

## Current State (Feb 2026)

- No active content creation
- No established audience
- Strong instinct for relatable content ideas
- Have the "teaching my dad/girlfriend Claude Code" concept
- Want to find a branding course to go through (need to research which one)

## Content Vision

**The vibe:** Relatable guy who builds cool things with AI, lives a great life in Stockholm, and shares the journey. Not a tech bro - a real person making technology work for real life.

**Content themes:**
1. **Building in public** - Maxa development, app launches, what works and what doesn't
2. **AI for real people** - Teaching non-technical people to use AI (the dad/girlfriend series)
3. **Product thinking** - How to think about what to build and why
4. **Life design** - The journey from consulting to freedom (honest, not guru-ish)
5. **Stockholm life** - Beautiful apartment, friends, family, Scandinavian lifestyle

**Tone:** Genuine, no-hype, smart but accessible, occasionally funny, never preachy.
