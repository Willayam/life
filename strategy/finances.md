# Financial Strategy

## Result
Income that covers life without trading hours for money. 10-15M SEK saved for apartment. Debt eliminated. Parental leave maximized.

## Purpose
Financial freedom = time freedom. I never want to take a project because I *have* to. I want to build from desire, not desperation. My family deserves security.

## Financial Data (Live)

All balances, accounts, income streams, and spending are tracked in the structured finance system:

- **Net worth & balances:** [finance/net-worth.yaml](../finance/net-worth.yaml)
- **Budget categories & income:** [finance/categories.yaml](../finance/categories.yaml)
- **Monthly transactions:** [finance/monthly/](../finance/monthly/)

Update balances in `net-worth.yaml` whenever they change. Git history tracks everything over time.

## Massive Action Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilize (Feb-Apr 2026)
- [x] Set consistent monthly salary from company for SGI optimization → **52,000 SEK/month, first payout Feb 2026**
- [ ] Pay off 200K debt (target: done by April at ~60K/month surplus)
- [ ] Begin paying back the 300K company loan to personal savings (tax-efficient)
- [ ] Keep Inkarnate engagement solid - this is the lifeline
- [ ] Launch Maxa and get first paying users

### Bookkeeping Plan (Feb 2026)
- [x] **Complete bookkeeping** for 2025 — all expenses booked except Tony Robbins + Acquisition.com
- [ ] **TODO (~2026-03-10, after Inkarnate payment):** Book remaining expenses: Tony Robbins
- **Note:** The Acquisition.com expense (55K) IS the deferred 2025 expense — same item, not separate
- [ ] **Defer 55K expense** (from 2025, Acquisition.com) — don't book until after salary payout so account isn't emptied
- [ ] **Cash flow calculation:**
  - ~100K in account
  - minus ~13-15K already booked expenses
  - minus 52,000 SEK salary payout
  - = remaining surplus → move to savings → invest in Tesla stock
- [ ] **Stripe cost separation:**
  - Marcus costs → pulled from William personally
  - App running/dev costs (Claude, infra) → paid from company/app
- [ ] **Get office organized** and find all papers

### Phase 2: Build (May-Jul 2026)
- [ ] Maxa growing toward 100+ paying subscribers
- [ ] Debt fully cleared, savings rebuilding
- [ ] Salary history established for maximum parental leave payout
- [ ] Clarity engagement active (if closed)
- [ ] Start content creation (builds toward product distribution)

### Phase 3: Parental Leave & Scale (Aug-Dec 2026)
- [ ] Parental leave with maximized SGI payout
- [ ] Maxa running and growing (systems in place)
- [ ] Content building audience
- [ ] Evaluate: Can I reduce/drop consulting when leave ends?

## Parental Leave Optimization (CRITICAL - TIME SENSITIVE)

**Baby due: End of July 2026**
**Months remaining to optimize: ~5 months (Feb-Jun)**

### How SGI (Sjukpenninggrundande inkomst) Works
- Försäkringskassan bases parental leave pay on your established income level
- For business owners: they look at your salary payment pattern
- **Inconsistent salary = lower SGI = less parental leave money**
- You need to establish a consistent salary NOW

### Action Items
- [x] **Determine optimal monthly salary level** → **52,000 SEK/month** — first payout Feb 25, 2026
- [ ] Ensure salary is paid on the 25th each month (consistency matters for SGI)
- [ ] Register with Försäkringskassan if not already done
- [ ] Understand the 240-day parental leave rules and how to split with Frida

### Salary Decision (2026-02-16)
**Decided: 52,000 SEK/month gross salary.**
- First payout: February 2026
- Must be consistent every month Feb-Jul to establish SGI before parental leave

## Path to 10-15M SEK (3-Year Horizon)

This won't come from consulting. It comes from:

1. **Product revenue (Maxa + future apps)** - Recurring subscriptions at scale
2. **Content/brand monetization** - Once audience is built
3. **Equity/ownership in things** - Products you own, not hours you sell
4. **Compound savings** - Once income exceeds needs by a wide margin

### Back-of-Napkin Math
- Maxa at 10,000 subscribers x 100 SEK/month = 1M SEK/month
- Even at 1,000 subscribers x 100 SEK/month = 100K SEK/month (replaces consulting)
- Multiple products multiply this

**The leverage play:** Each product you build has near-zero marginal cost per user. This is why consulting can never get you to 10-15M - but products can.

## Monthly Financial Review Checklist

Run monthly (or ask Claude to compute from the YAML files):

- [ ] Update all balances in `finance/net-worth.yaml`
- [ ] Review `finance/monthly/YYYY-MM.yaml` — actual vs budget
- [ ] Calculate net worth change from last month (git diff)
- [ ] Check: Am I spending in proportion to what matters? (category → life category mapping)
- [ ] What is remaining debt?
- [ ] Is Maxa generating revenue? How much?
- [ ] Am I on track for parental leave SGI target?
- [ ] Create next month's `finance/monthly/YYYY-MM.yaml` from template
