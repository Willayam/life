## Massive Action Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilize (Feb-Apr 2026)

- [ ] Launch Maxa and get first paying users

### Phase 2: Build (May-Jul 2026)

### Phase 3: Parental Leave & Scale (Aug-Dec 2026)

## Parental Leave Optimization (CRITICAL - TIME SENSITIVE)

**Baby due: End of July 2026**
**Months remaining to optimize: ~5 months (Feb-Jun)**

### How SGI (Sjukpenninggrundande inkomst) Works
- Försäkringskassan bases parental leave pay on your established income level
- For business owners: they look at your salary payment pattern
- **Inconsistent salary = lower SGI = less parental leave money**
- You need to establish a consistent salary NOW

### Action Items
- [ ] **URGENT:** Determine optimal monthly salary level to report
  - Must be high enough to maximize SGI
  - Must be sustainable given company revenue
  - Must be consistent every month from now until leave
- [ ] Talk to an accountant about optimal salary vs dividend split for SGI purposes
- [ ] Ensure salary is paid on the same date each month (consistency matters)
- [ ] Register with Försäkringskassan if not already done
- [ ] Understand the 240-day parental leave rules and how to split with Frida

### Key Question to Resolve
What is the maximum salary you can consistently pay yourself from the company given:
- 90K/month revenue from Inkarnate
- Company expenses (tools, potential e-bike lease, etc.)
- Need to also pay back the 300K personal loan from company

**A rough target might be 45,000-55,000 SEK/month salary** but this needs accountant input.

## Path to 10-15M SEK (3-Year Horizon)

This won't come from consulting. It comes from:

1. **Product revenue (Maxa + future apps)** - Recurring subscriptions at scale
2. **Content/brand monetization** - Once audience is built
3. **Equity/ownership in things** - Products you own, not hours you sell
4. **Compound savings** - Once income exceeds needs by a wide margin

### Back-of-Napkin Math
- Maxa at 10,000 subscribers x 100 SEK/month = 1M SEK/month
- Even at 1,000 subscribers x 100 SEK/month = 100K SEK/month (replaces consulting)
- Multiple products multiply this

**The leverage play:** Each product you build has near-zero marginal cost per user. This is why consulting can never get you to 10-15M - but products can.
