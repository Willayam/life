# Consulting Performance Analysis: Honest Assessment

_Generated 2026-02-25. Based on analysis of daily logs, weekly plans, financial data, project tracking, and behavioral patterns across the entire Life OS._

## The Core Question

You want to 10x your income, deliver more value, and use your time more effectively. You currently earn 90,000 SEK/month (~$10K USD) from consulting. 10x means ~$100K/month.

Here is an honest, pattern-based analysis of what's actually happening versus what you say you want.

---

## 1. You Are Chronically Under-Pricing Yourself

**The evidence:**
- You charge Inkarnate 90,000 SEK/month (~$10K USD) for senior product consulting: UX strategy, editor redesign, performance strategy, landing page work, and map creation flow overhaul.
- You have: Head of Product experience, Tony Robbins Platinum Partnership network, AI-augmented shipping capability, 1000+ books of pattern recognition, and the ability to do both strategy AND execution.
- A product consultant with this profile in the US/EU market charges $200-400/hour. At even 80 hours/month, that's $16K-32K/month per client.

**The gap:** You treat consulting as "bridge income" — something to tolerate while you build products. This mindset ensures you never optimize it. You don't negotiate rates, don't expand scope to capture more value, and don't position yourself as premium. You've made consulting the thing you're escaping FROM, which guarantees you'll underinvest in it.

**The Clarity deal makes this worse:** You're taking a $1K/month floor to cover all dev costs on a platform with exposed Stripe keys, two simultaneous backends, and Angular technical debt. Last summer, they paid $10K/month for a 2-month sprint with narrower scope. You're now doing significantly more work for 90% less money, justified by "upside" from a 50/50 profit split on a platform that currently has minimal revenue. The risk-reward is tilted heavily against you.

**What to do differently:**
- Raise your Inkarnate rate. You've been at 90K/month — when was the last time you increased it? Your value has compounded. Propose a rate increase tied to the scope expansion you're delivering (performance strategy, landing page, map creation flow are NEW workstreams beyond the original engagement).
- For Clarity: the $1K floor should be $5K minimum if you're covering all dev costs. $1K/month doesn't even cover Marcus. You're subsidizing their product development. The "equity conversation later" is not compensation — it's a hope.
- Stop framing consulting as something beneath you. It's your highest-certainty income stream. Optimize it.

## 2. Maxa Has Been "Days Not Weeks" Away for 19+ Days

**The evidence:**
- Feb 6: "Feeling frustrated with Maxa not being shipped yet. The question extraction is the blocker. Want to get that done in days, not weeks."
- Feb 13: "App QA is terrible." Still working on it. Also researching email classifiers, Framer replication, claymorphism.
- Feb 17-23 (W08): Top result was "Maxa app fully tested and ready for TestFlight." End of week review: empty.
- Feb 24-Mar 1 (W09): Top result is "Maxa submitted to the App Store." Question extraction still incomplete. Still listed as blocker.

**19 days later, the same blocker exists.** The question extraction that was "days, not weeks" is now weeks.

**The gap:** You plan Maxa as priority #1 every single week. Then you give it the leftover time after Inkarnate meetings, Clarity proposals, Expa handoffs, social events, Vasaloppet prep, financial admin, Functional Patterns research, and Heaper exploration. Look at W09 Tuesday: Maxa gets the 15:00-17:30 slot — 2.5 hours — after Expa and Inkarnate take the first 4 hours of the day. Maxa is priority #1 in your documents but priority #4 in your calendar.

**What to do differently:**
- If Maxa is truly the #1 bet, give it the FIRST hours of the day, not the last. Deep creative work happens in your freshest state, not after context-switching through Expa and Inkarnate.
- Set a hard ship date. Public. Tell 10 people. "Maxa is in the App Store by March 7." The deadline creates the forcing function your solo work style needs.
- Identify the actual atomic tasks blocking question extraction and do ONLY those. Not claymorphism. Not mascots. Not AppMap design QA tools. The questions going into the app.

## 3. Your Planning System May Be Consuming the Time It's Supposed to Create

**The evidence:**
- You maintain: daily brain dumps, weekly RPM plans with time-blocked schedules, financial strategy docs, project trackers, people CRM files, health dashboard, content strategy, 2026 bets strategy, Obsidian vault with internal linking, custom Claude Code skills, Google Calendar integration.
- Your weekly plans are highly detailed (W09 is 250 lines with hour-by-hour breakdowns for each day).
- Your end-of-week reviews are consistently empty ("What Got Done: —", "What Didn't Get Done: —", "Key Insight: —").

**The gap:** You're investing significant time in planning elaborate systems and not completing the reflection loop that makes them valuable. A planning system without retrospectives is just a to-do list generator. The plans get more detailed each week, but the reviews stay blank — which means you're not learning from what didn't work.

More importantly: time spent building and maintaining the system is time not spent shipping Maxa or doing consulting work. The Life OS itself has become a project that competes for attention.

**What to do differently:**
- Simplify radically. Your weekly plan should be: 3 results, time blocks, done. Not 250 lines.
- Complete the review EVERY week. Even 5 bullet points. The review is where the learning happens. Without it, you're planning in the dark.
- Stop adding features to the system (custom skills, calendar integrations, email classifiers). The system is for shipping work, not for being worked on.

## 4. The "New Idea" Pattern Is Your Biggest Threat

**The evidence, just from the last 3 weeks:**
- Email classifier project
- Framer/Vaylo replication project
- Claymorphism implementation
- AppMap automated flow visualization tool
- Functional Patterns training research
- Heaper local-first workspace research
- Mac Mini home server idea
- Mortality Map interactive visualization
- Content branding course research
- "Taught my dad Claude Code" series planning

Each of these appeared in a daily brain dump or planning document. Each one pulled attention, even briefly, away from the stated priority. You even wrote yourself the note: "Don't let the shiny stuff eat the important stuff" (Feb 13). Then on Feb 24 — 11 days later — you wrote detailed notes about Heaper and Functional Patterns training instead of working on Maxa question extraction.

**The gap:** You are a high-openness, pattern-recognition person who gets energy from new ideas. This is your superpower in strategy and consulting. It is your kryptonite in execution. Every new idea feels like progress because it engages your strongest cognitive mode. But it's not progress — it's motion.

**What to do differently:**
- Create an "ideas parking lot" file and ONLY put ideas there. No research. No links. No "next steps." Just the idea name and one sentence. Review it monthly.
- When you catch yourself researching something that isn't Maxa, Inkarnate, or Clarity: stop. Write the idea down. Close the tab. Return to the actual work.
- Recognize the pattern in real-time: "I'm about to spend 30 minutes researching Heaper. Is this shipping Maxa? No. Parking lot."

## 5. You Don't Track Your Time — So You Can't Optimize It

**The evidence:**
- Your Inkarnate section says "Track hours — keep this efficient, don't let it creep."
- There is zero time tracking data anywhere in the repository.
- Your weekly plans have time blocks, but no record of whether you followed them or what actually happened.

**The gap:** You can't improve what you don't measure. You have detailed financial tracking (every SEK accounted for) but zero time tracking. Yet time is the scarce resource — you have 5 months before parental leave fundamentally changes your capacity. You don't know how many hours you actually spend on Inkarnate vs. Maxa vs. system maintenance vs. idea research vs. admin.

**What to do differently:**
- Use a simple time tracker (Toggl, Clockify, even a daily 3-line note: "Maxa: 2h, Inkarnate: 3h, Other: 2h"). Track for 2 weeks. The data will shock you.
- Set target ratios: e.g., "50% Maxa, 30% Inkarnate, 10% Clarity, 10% admin." Compare against actuals weekly.

---

## 6. You Need Collaborative Energy But Haven't Systematized Getting It

**The evidence:**
- "I thrive orchestrating people, ideas, and tools — not grinding solo on repetitive execution."
- "Need external accountability and collaborative energy."
- Maxa — your #1 priority — is a solo grind. No co-founder. No accountability partner. No weekly check-in with anyone on it.
- Inkarnate has weekly team check-ins → it gets consistent attention.
- Clarity has meeting cadence with Todd/Mikey → it progresses.
- Maxa has... you, alone, trying to force yourself through question extraction.

**The gap:** You've diagnosed your core weakness (solo execution) accurately. You've designed zero systems to compensate for it on your most important project. Your consulting work moves forward because other people create structure around it. Maxa stalls because no one is waiting for your deliverable.

**What to do differently:**
- Get an accountability partner for Maxa. Weekly 15-minute call. "What did you ship this week? What's the blocker? What will you ship next week?"
- Consider: Is there someone who could do the question extraction? You're a product strategist doing data entry. This might be a task you should pay someone 5,000 SEK to do in 3 days while you focus on higher-value work.
- Create external deadlines: "Olivia is testing on TestFlight by Friday" creates more urgency than "submit to App Store (no date)."

## 7. The 10x Income Math Doesn't Add Up Yet

**Your current path to 10x:**
- Maxa at 10,000 subscribers × 100 SEK/month = 1M SEK/month

**Reality check:**
- Maxa hasn't launched. Zero subscribers. Zero revenue.
- The Swedish university entrance exam market has ~80,000 test-takers per year. 10,000 paying subscribers is 12.5% market penetration for a new, unproven app. That's extremely ambitious.
- 1,000 subscribers (your "replaces consulting" milestone) is 1.25% penetration — achievable but still requires significant marketing effort you haven't started.
- You have no marketing channel. Content strategy is "Phase 0: not started." No audience. No distribution.

**The gap:** Your 10x plan requires (1) shipping a product that's been stuck for weeks, (2) acquiring thousands of paying users with no marketing infrastructure, and (3) doing this while maintaining consulting, managing a partnership deal, preparing for a baby, and being present for a 4-year-old. The ambition is right. The sequencing is broken.

**What to do differently:**
- Path A (Product): Accept that Maxa alone won't 10x you in 2026. It might generate 10-50K SEK/month by year end if you ship NOW and market aggressively. That's still transformative, but it's not 10x.
- Path B (Consulting): A faster path to 2-3x is optimizing your consulting. Raise rates. Add a second high-paying client. Package your product strategy + AI capability as a premium offering (150-200K SEK/month). This is less exciting but far more predictable.
- Path C (Both): Ship Maxa as fast as humanly possible (strip features, launch ugly, iterate). Simultaneously raise consulting rates and position yourself as premium. Use consulting revenue to fund Maxa marketing. Content starts generating audience for both.
- Path C is the only one that's realistic for 2026.

## 8. You're Solving for Optionality When You Need to Solve for Focus

**The evidence:**
- 5 active projects (Maxa, Inkarnate, Clarity, Expa, Frida's school offer)
- 6 queued projects (email classifier, Framer replication, Mortality Map, AI automation, content products, Michael opportunities)
- Content strategy with 7 content ideas, branding course research, platform selection
- Financial optimization across salary, debt, SGI, bookkeeping, Stripe reporting, Tesla stock

**The gap:** You have the strategic portfolio of someone running a 20-person company. You are one person with a 4-year-old and a baby coming in 5 months. The "small bets" philosophy is sound in theory, but you haven't made even ONE bet pay off yet. You need your first win, not your fifth option.

**What to do differently:**
- Kill or pause everything that isn't directly generating revenue or directly shipping Maxa.
- Expa: send the closeout message TODAY. Not "draft handoff notes." Not "route questions to Erik." One message: "I'm done. Erik handles everything going forward. Here's his contact." Done in 15 minutes, not an ongoing workstream.
- Frida's school offer: explicitly defer to post-parental-leave. It's idea stage. It doesn't need your attention for 6 months.
- Content: don't research branding courses. Don't evaluate platforms. When Maxa ships, document the launch. That IS your content.
- Queue projects: delete them from active tracking. Put them in a "someday" file you review quarterly.

## Summary: The 5 Changes That Would Transform Your Trajectory

1. **Price yourself correctly.** Raise Inkarnate rate by 30-50%. Renegotiate Clarity floor to $5K. Stop treating consulting as something you're escaping — it's your engine.

2. **Ship Maxa in the next 10 days.** Strip it to the minimum. 4 tests. No mascot. No claymorphism. No perfect calculation algorithm. Get it in the store. Real users > perfect product.

3. **Track your time for 2 weeks.** You'll discover where your hours actually go. The gap between plan and reality is where your income is leaking.

4. **Kill the idea addiction.** One "ideas parking lot" file. No research on new things until Maxa is live and Inkarnate is renegotiated. The next time you're about to explore Heaper or a Mortality Map, ask: "Is this shipping Maxa?"

5. **Get external accountability for Maxa.** One person. Weekly call. 15 minutes. "What did you ship?" This single change would probably do more for Maxa's timeline than any other.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

You are extremely good at strategic thinking, planning, synthesizing, and connecting ideas. You know this. It's your identity. But right now, the bottleneck isn't strategy — it's execution. More plans won't help. More frameworks won't help. More ideas won't help. The only thing that moves the needle is shipping: getting Maxa in the store, getting the Inkarnate rate raised, getting real revenue from real customers.

You have 5 months before a baby arrives and your capacity drops dramatically. Every week of planning, researching, and exploring is a week you don't get back. The strategy is already good enough. The system is already good enough. Now the only question is: will you do the work?
