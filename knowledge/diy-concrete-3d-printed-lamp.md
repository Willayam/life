# DIY Lamp: Concrete Base + 3D Printed Shade

## Concept

Build a custom lamp combining two materials:

1. **Base: Poured concrete** - Create a mold (could 3D print the mold itself), pour concrete, let cure. Gives weight and industrial/minimalist aesthetic.
2. **Shade: 3D printed in TPU** - Flexible filament allows interesting organic/geometric shapes. TPU lets light diffuse through depending on wall thickness and infill pattern.

## Open Questions to Explore

- Mold design: 3D print a mold for the concrete base? Silicone mold?
- How to embed wiring channel in the concrete pour
- TPU shade: wall thickness for good light diffusion?
- Lamp hardware: socket type, cord routing, switch placement
- Concrete mix: standard or white cement for cleaner look?
- Surface finish on concrete: raw, sanded, sealed?
- Shade attachment method to base
