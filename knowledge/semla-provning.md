# Semla Provning (Semla Tasting)

## The Concept

A semla tasting event with friends - 18 different semlor from different bakeries/cafes, rated and compared. Best way to eat semla: invite good friends and do a proper provning.

## 2026 Edition - Learnings & Takeaways

- **Date:** Around Fettisdagen 2026
- **Format:** 18 semlor, multiple tasters, great time
- **Verdict:** Amazing. Best. Do this every year.

### Bakeries/Sources Used (2026)

_TODO: Fill in the 18 places so we don't duplicate next year_

## App Idea: Semla Provning App

Vibecode a simple app for next year's tasting. Features:

### Taster Flow
- Add your name
- For each semla, rate:
  - **Bun** (score)
  - **Cream** (score)
  - **Mandelmassa** (score)
  - **Overall experience** (score)
  - **Comments** / tasting notes (free text)
- See a photo of the semla while rating

### Admin Flow (Assembly Line)
- Semla comes in from contributor
- Admin takes photo of the contributor + the semla
- Semla gets cut up and assigned a number in the lineup
- Track which bakery/place each semla came from
- Prevent duplicate sources across years

### Live Scoreboard
- Live-updating aggregate scores as ratings come in
- **Winner is hidden** until reveal - builds suspense
- Admin controls when to reveal the winner

### Tech Notes
- Should be simple enough to vibecode in a day
- Mobile-friendly (everyone rates on their phone)
- Real-time updates (websockets or polling)
- Photo upload for each semla entry

## Annual Planning

- **When:** Week before Fettisdagen (falls on a Tuesday, varies by year)
- **Fettisdagen 2027:** Check Swedish calendar for exact date
- **Lead time needed:**
  - 2-3 weeks before: Build/update the app
  - 1 week before: Order semlor from different places
  - Day of: Set up assembly line, invite friends
- **Key rule:** Don't duplicate bakeries from previous years (track in this doc)
