# RPM Framework

**R**esults - **P**urpose - **M**assive Action Plan

## The Core Idea

Most people make to-do lists (actions without meaning). RPM flips it:

1. **Result:** What specifically do I want? (Clear, measurable outcome)
2. **Purpose:** Why do I want it? (The emotional fuel - this is what drives action)
3. **Massive Action Plan:** What am I going to do to achieve it? (Specific steps)

## Why It Works for Me

- Reduces overwhelm by forcing prioritization
- The "purpose" step creates emotional connection to the work
- When I use it consistently, it's been really powerful
- Challenge: I haven't been able to apply it consistently (yet)

## Application in Life OS

Every life category, project, and weekly plan follows RPM:
- Each document starts with Result and Purpose
- Weekly reviews use the RPM template
- Daily notes capture the #1 result for tomorrow

## Key Insight

The purpose step is the most important and most often skipped. Without it, you're just grinding through tasks with no fuel.
