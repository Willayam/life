# Indexes

Cross-cutting views across the vault. These are **maintained by Claude** as convenience layers — the source of truth lives in the individual files (projects, people, daily notes, etc.).

## Files

- **tasks.md** — All open action items across the vault. Single source of truth for "what do I need to do?"
- **waiting-for.md** — Things waiting on other people. Prevents follow-ups from falling through cracks.

## Rules

- Claude updates these during sessions when tasks are added, completed, or changed
- These are generated views, not primary records
- If an index and a source file disagree, the source file wins
- Keep these concise — link to source files for details
