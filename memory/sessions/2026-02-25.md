# Session: 2026-02-25

## Topics Discussed

- **Personal knowledge management architecture** — researched whether to use Convex database vs. keep markdown + git. Concluded markdown is the right primary system for LLM consumption.
- **Always-on life server** — researched hardware options (Mac Mini, N100, Pi 5, VPS), Tailscale, Obsidian Sync, background sync scripts. Designed full architecture.
- **Obsidian compatibility** — confirmed all proposed changes are fully compatible with Obsidian wiki-links, frontmatter, Dataview, graph view.
- **Structural upgrades to vault** — designed and implemented: memory/ (session logs, commitments, decisions), indexes/ (tasks, waiting-for), updated Claude.md with session rituals, standardized templates.

## Decisions Made

- Stay with markdown + git, don't build a database (see [[personal-knowledge-management-architecture]])
- Mac Mini long-term for always-on server, start with Obsidian Sync + Tailscale now (see [[always-on-life-server-architecture]])
- Added session memory system for Claude continuity between conversations

## Action Items Generated

- [ ] Set up Obsidian Sync ($4/month) — immediate, do today
- [ ] Install Tailscale on laptop + phone — immediate, do today
- [ ] Research Mac Mini / server hardware — when bandwidth allows
- [ ] Adapt Gmail/Calendar scripts for markdown output — when server is ready
