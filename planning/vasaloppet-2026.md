## 2. GEAR & CLOTHING

### Race Clothing - Layering System

**Base Layer (next to skin - moisture wicking)**
- [ ] Merino wool or synthetic long-sleeve base top
- [ ] Merino wool or synthetic base layer bottoms / long tights
- [ ] Thin liner socks (polypropylene) under main socks
- [ ] Wool or wool-blend ski socks (not too thick - restricts circulation)

**Mid Layer (insulation)**
- [ ] Lightweight fleece or vest for core warmth
- [ ] Consider: vest instead of full jacket for arm freedom on the poles

**Outer Layer (wind/weather protection)**
- [ ] Cross-country ski jacket (windproof, breathable, water-resistant)
- [ ] Cross-country ski pants / racing tights with wind protection
- [ ] Lightweight packable wind vest (in case conditions change)

**Head & Neck**
- [ ] Lightweight wool or synthetic ski hat / buff
- [ ] Neck gaiter / buff (can pull up over face in wind)

**Feet**
- [ ] **Foot warmers** (adhesive toe warmers) - pack 2-3 pairs

## 3. NUTRITION & FUEL PLAN

### Protein/Chocolate Bar Recipe (make Friday night / Saturday morning)

**Base:**
- Oatmeal (rolled oats)
- Protein powder
- Peanut butter powder
- Cocoa powder
- Greek yogurt
- Almond milk (enough to bind)

**Topping:**
- Dark chocolate (melted)
- Coconut oil (mixed with chocolate)

**Instructions:**
1. Mix all dry ingredients (oats, protein powder, PB powder, cocoa)
2. Add Greek yogurt and almond milk, stir until thick dough
3. Press into lined baking dish or form into bars
4. Refrigerate 1-2 hours until firm
5. Melt dark chocolate + coconut oil, spread/drizzle on top
6. Refrigerate until set, cut into bar-sized pieces
7. Wrap individually in parchment paper or foil for easy access during race

**Tips for race fuel bars:**
- Make them small enough to eat in 2-3 bites while skiing
- Add a pinch of salt to replace electrolytes
- Consider adding honey or maple syrup for quick-release carbs
- Make ~8-10 small bars, plan to eat one every 30-45 min

### Carb Loading (Thursday-Saturday)
- [ ] Increase carbs to 10-12 g per kg of body weight
- [ ] Good options: pasta, bread with jam, oatmeal, rice, potatoes
- [ ] Keep fiber LOW (especially Saturday) to avoid stomach issues
- [ ] Stay hydrated - water + electrolytes
- [ ] Avoid: heavy fat, excessive fiber, alcohol, new/unfamiliar foods

### Saturday Evening (Night Before Race)
- [ ] Large carb-rich dinner: pasta or rice with protein
- [ ] Include some healthy fats and protein
- [ ] Avoid high-fiber vegetables
- [ ] Hydrate well but stop 1-2 hours before bed (avoid waking up to pee)
- [ ] Lay out ALL race gear tonight - no morning scramble

### Race Morning (Sunday, ~5:00-5:30 wake up)
- [ ] Eat 2-3 hours before start (so by 5:00-5:30 latest)
- [ ] Oatmeal with honey/jam + banana + peanut butter
- [ ] Coffee if that is normal routine
- [ ] Small amount of protein (yogurt, eggs)
- [ ] 500 ml water or sports drink
- [ ] Avoid: heavy/greasy food, excessive fiber, dairy if sensitive

### During Race Fueling (aim for ~60g carbs/hour)
- [ ] Homemade protein/chocolate bars (eat every 30-45 min)
- [ ] Energy gels as backup (2-3 in belt)
- [ ] Small bag of Swedish candy / dried fruit for quick sugar
- [ ] Use checkpoint food: blueberry soup is excellent fuel (sugar + liquid)
- [ ] Eat the Vasaloppet buns (bread = carbs)
- [ ] Drink at EVERY checkpoint - small sips, do not skip
- [ ] Sports drink or water from checkpoints
- [ ] Bring a small flask with warm sports drink or tea for between stations
- [ ] Coffee at Eldris (km 81) for the final push if needed

### Post-Race
- [ ] Recovery drink immediately at finish

- [ ] Rehydrate aggressively
- [ ] Collect bag from lorry, change into warm dry clothes ASAP

## 4. PRE-RACE COLD RECOVERY (Thursday-Sunday)

### Evidence-Based Recovery Protocol

**Sleep (MOST IMPORTANT)**
- [ ] 8-9 hours sleep Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights
- [ ] Dark, cool room (18C ideal)
- [ ] No screens 1 hour before bed
- [ ] If Frida has sleep research tips, use them - she is the expert

**Hydration & Nutrition**
- [ ] Drink 2-3 liters water/day
- [ ] Warm drinks: tea with honey, warm water with lemon
- [ ] Chicken soup / bone broth (anti-inflammatory)
- [ ] Vitamin C-rich foods: citrus, bell peppers, berries
- [ ] Zinc lozenges at first sign of symptoms (modest evidence but low risk)
- [ ] Avoid alcohol completely until after the race

**Activity**
- [ ] Light movement only (short walks, gentle stretching)
- [ ] No hard training Thursday-Saturday
- [ ] "Above the neck" rule: if symptoms are only above the neck (runny nose, sore throat), racing is generally safe
- [ ] If symptoms go below the neck (chest congestion, body aches, fever) - seriously reconsider racing

**Medications - Be Careful**
- [ ] Avoid multi-symptom cold meds with phenylephrine (affects heart rate)
- [ ] Nasal spray (saline) is safe and helpful
- [ ] Paracetamol for headache/sore throat is fine
- [ ] Avoid NSAIDs (ibuprofen) right before endurance events - kidney stress
- [ ] Bring throat lozenges for the trip

**What to Avoid**
- [ ] Alcohol
- [ ] Hard training
- [ ] Late nights
- [ ] Stress
- [ ] Cold exposure / getting chilled
- [ ] Crowded indoor spaces (avoid picking up something new)
