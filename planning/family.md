# Family & Relationships

## Result
Deep, passionate relationship with Frida. Present, engaged father to Charlie (and baby coming July). A home that's a hub for friends and joy. Strong inner circle.

## Purpose
This is what the freedom is FOR. No amount of money or products matters if these relationships aren't thriving.

## Frida

PhD sleep researcher, entrepreneur. Partner. Baby coming end of July 2026.

**How to show up for her:**
- Support her business pivot - help create a scalable offer for schools (sleep + play for kids)
- She's stressed about income - being financially stable helps both of us
- Quality time together, not just coexisting while both work
- Great sex is a relationship barometer - prioritize connection

**Frida's project opportunity:**
- She wants to work with schools on sleep/play for kids
- Maxa is also going into schools (högskoleprovet students)
- Potential synergy: shared distribution channel to schools?
- [ ] Brainstorm with Frida: What would her ideal offer to schools look like?
- [ ] Can we package something together or share marketing channels?

## Charlie (Age 4)

Shared custody 50/50 with his mother. Preschool is 45 min away.

**Priorities:**
- Be fully present during my time with him (not distracted by phone/laptop)
- Make the commute less painful (e-bike solution)
- Fun, enriching activities together
- Consistent routines

**The preschool logistics:**
- Current: 45 min each way = up to 3-4 hours/day lost
- Solution: E-bike lease (company tax advantage) → ~20 min each way
- [ ] Research e-bike options and company lease terms
- [ ] Factor biking time as exercise (win-win)

**Custody calendar:** Shared via Google Calendar with ex.

## Baby #2 (Due Late July 2026)

**Preparation:**
- [ ] Parental leave salary optimization (see [finances.md](../strategy/finances.md))
- [ ] Apartment prep - nursery/space planning
- [ ] Systems running before baby arrives (Maxa, content, consulting)
- [ ] The more automated income we have by July, the more present I can be
