## Frida

PhD sleep researcher, entrepreneur. Partner. Baby coming end of July 2026.

**How to show up for her:**
- Support her business pivot - help create a scalable offer for schools (sleep + play for kids)
- She's stressed about income - being financially stable helps both of us
- Quality time together, not just coexisting while both work
- Great sex is a relationship barometer - prioritize connection

**Frida's project opportunity:**
- She wants to work with schools on sleep/play for kids
- Maxa is also going into schools (högskoleprovet students)
- Potential synergy: shared distribution channel to schools?
- [ ] Brainstorm with Frida: What would her ideal offer to schools look like?
- [ ] Can we package something together or share marketing channels?

## Charlie (Age 4)

Shared custody 50/50 with his mother. Preschool is 45 min away.

**Priorities:**
- Be fully present during my time with him (not distracted by phone/laptop)
- Make the commute less painful (e-bike solution)
- Fun, enriching activities together
- Consistent routines

**The preschool logistics:**
- Current: 45 min each way = up to 3-4 hours/day lost
- Solution: E-bike lease (company tax advantage) → ~20 min each way
- [ ] Research e-bike options and company lease terms
- [ ] Factor biking time as exercise (win-win)

**Custody calendar:** Shared via Google Calendar with ex.

### Charlie Day Rhythm

Charlie days are not "work days with a kid." They're dad days with 2 work blocks. Accepting this removes guilt and sets realistic expectations.

**Charlie Day Schedule:**
- 6:30 — Wake (30 min earlier than non-Charlie days)
- 6:30-7:15 — Morning routine (compressed) + Charlie breakfast
- 7:15-7:45 — Preschool departure + commute (~20 min with e-bike, ~45 min now)
- Drop-off → 10:45 — **Deep work block 1** (#1 result only)
- 10:45-11:00 — Break
- 11:00-12:30 — **Deep work block 2** (consulting / most urgent)
- 12:30-13:00 — Lunch
- 13:00-13:30 — Admin/email batch
- 13:30 — **Shutdown ritual** (pick tomorrow's #1, close everything)
- 14:00+ — Charlie pickup → full presence. No work. Phone in bag during pickup.

**Charlie Evening:**
- Dinner together, play, bath, bedtime routine
- After Charlie is in bed → 2-min transition ritual → Frida time
- See [[routines]] for transition rituals

**Non-Charlie Week:**
- Full deep work schedule (4 blocks/day, shutdown at 16:00)
- Evenings free for Frida, friends, social, personal projects
- This is when to schedule friend dinners, date nights, social events

## Baby #2 (Due Late July 2026)

**Preparation:**
- [ ] Parental leave salary optimization (see [finances.md](../strategy/finances.md))
- [ ] Apartment prep - nursery/space planning
- [ ] Systems running before baby arrives (Maxa, content, consulting)
- [ ] The more automated income we have by July, the more present I can be
