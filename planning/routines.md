# Friction Elimination

## Result
The boring stuff runs itself. Clothing, food, groceries, commuting, cleaning, errands — all on autopilot so I spend less time on logistics and more time with Frida, Charlie, friends, and building.

## Purpose
Every small daily friction — picking an outfit, figuring out dinner, hunting for Charlie's extra clothes, making another grocery run — costs 5-15 minutes and a slice of mental energy. Individually they're nothing. Stacked up across a week, they steal hours and leave me feeling busy without being productive. The fix isn't discipline. It's defaults.

---

## Clothing

**The problem:** Standing in front of the closet deciding. Laundry piling up. Not having the right thing clean when you need it.

### Fixes

**Uniform thinking — reduce the choices**
- Pick 2-3 "daily defaults" that work for any normal day (e.g., dark jeans/chinos + solid t-shirt/henley + one layer). Wear variations of the same thing.
- Buy multiples of what works. If you find a t-shirt you like, buy 3-5 in neutral colors (black, navy, grey, white). Same with socks and underwear — all identical, no matching needed.
- [ ] Do a closet audit: pull out everything you haven't worn in 6 months → bag it, donate it. Fewer clothes = faster choices.
- [ ] Identify your "daily default" outfit and stock up on duplicates

**Night-before prep**
- Lay out tomorrow's clothes before bed. Takes 30 seconds at night, saves 5 minutes of morning decision-making.
- On Charlie days: lay out Charlie's clothes too.

**Laundry on autopilot**
- Pick 2 fixed laundry days per week (e.g., Wednesday + Sunday). Don't think about it — just run a load on those days.
- Same-type socks and underwear mean you never sort or match. Just grab.
- [ ] Set recurring reminders for laundry days
- [ ] Replace mismatched socks/underwear with identical sets

**One "ready to go" outfit**
- Keep one nice outfit always clean and ready — for spontaneous dinners, unexpected meetings, going out with Frida. Knowing you have this eliminates the "I have nothing to wear" panic.

## Groceries

**The problem:** Multiple trips to the store per week, forgetting things, deciding what to buy, carrying bags, wasted food.

### Fixes

**Switch to online delivery as the default**
- Stockholm options: Mat.se, ICA online, Coop online — all deliver next day or same day.
- One order per week. Sunday evening → delivered Monday.
- This alone saves 1-2 hours/week and eliminates impulse buys.
- [ ] Set up an account on your preferred grocery delivery service
- [ ] Place first online order this Sunday

**The master list**
- Create a "forever list" of staples you always need. Copy-paste it into each weekly order and just add/remove a few items. Never build a grocery list from scratch again.

**Staples (always in the house):**
- [ ] Define your list — start with this and edit to taste:

| Category | Always stocked |
|----------|---------------|
| Protein | Chicken breast/thigh, ground turkey/beef, eggs, Greek yogurt, protein powder |
| Carbs | Rice, pasta, oats, bread, potatoes |
| Produce | Bananas, apples, spinach/mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, garlic, frozen veg mix |
| Fats | Olive oil, butter, nuts (almonds/cashews), peanut butter |
| Snacks | Greek yogurt, fruit, nuts, protein bars, dark chocolate |
| Drinks | Coffee, milk/oat milk |
| Pantry | Salt, pepper, soy sauce, canned tomatoes, stock cubes |
| Household | Dish soap, paper towels, trash bags, toilet paper |

**Meal rotation (stop deciding what's for dinner)**
- Pick 10 dinners that you and Frida both like. Rotate through them. Pick 5 per week on Sunday.
- Not every meal needs to be creative. Monday can always be pasta. Tuesday can always be chicken + rice + veg. Boring is fast.
- [ ] Sit down with Frida: list 10 dinners you both enjoy
- [ ] Create the rotation list and keep it here (update below)

## Food & Cooking

**The problem:** Deciding what to eat, not having ingredients ready, cooking from scratch every night.

### Fixes

**Breakfast on autopilot**
- Pick 2 breakfasts. Alternate. Stop thinking about it.
- Examples: (A) overnight oats prepped night before, (B) eggs + toast + fruit
- [ ] Pick your 2 default breakfasts

**Lunch = leftovers or one default**
- Cook extra at dinner → lunch is solved.
- Backup default: big salad with protein (chicken, eggs, tuna) — always have ingredients for this via the staples list.

**Sunday batch prep (~45 min)**
- Not a full meal prep marathon. Just remove friction from the week:
  - Cook 1 big protein (whole chicken, big batch of ground meat sauce, etc.)
  - Cook 1 big carb (pot of rice, roast potatoes)
  - Wash and chop vegetables for the week
- That's it. Now weeknight dinners go from 45 min → 15-20 min because the base is done.
- [ ] Try one Sunday batch prep this week

**Kitchen clean-as-you-go**
- Clean while cooking, not after. Waiting time = cleaning time. Finish eating → kitchen is almost already clean.
- Run dishwasher every night. Empty it in the morning while coffee brews. Never let dishes stack up.

## Commuting & Getting Around

**The problem:** Preschool is 45 min each way. That's potentially 3 hours/day on Charlie days spent just traveling.

### Fixes

**E-bike (the single biggest friction win)**
- 45 min → ~20 min each way. Saves ~50 min per round trip.
- Built-in daily exercise on Charlie days.
- Company lease = tax advantage (förmånscykel).
- [ ] Research: which e-bikes work for child seat / cargo (Charlie is 4 — needs rear seat or cargo front)
- [ ] Research: förmånscykel lease options through company
- [ ] Test ride at a local shop
- [ ] Decision deadline: end of February

**The "launch pad" by the door**
- One spot where everything lives: keys, wallet, phone, headphones, sunglasses.
- A hook or shelf right by the front door. Every time you walk in, things go there. Every time you walk out, you grab from there.
- Zero time spent looking for keys/wallet. Ever.
- [ ] Set up a launch pad (tray/hook/shelf by front door)

**Charlie's go-bag**
- A bag that is always packed with Charlie essentials: extra clothes, snacks, water bottle, small toy/book.
- Restock it when you get home, not when you're rushing out the door.
- [ ] Set up Charlie's go-bag and designate a hook for it by the door

**Night-before exit prep**
- Before bed: everything needed for tomorrow morning is by the door or in the hallway.
  - Bag packed
  - Shoes accessible
  - Charlie's stuff ready (if Charlie day)
  - Bike/stroller/car prepped
- Morning departure goes from 10-min scramble → grab and go.

## The Home (Daily Living)

**The problem:** Mess creeps up, then becomes overwhelming. Office is disorganized. Can't find things when you need them (bookkeeping papers!). The "house is messy" thought drains energy.

### Fixes

**Everything has a home**
- The reason things pile up is that they don't have a designated spot. If mail doesn't have a specific place, it ends up on the counter, then the table, then a pile.
- [ ] Designate homes for the main clutter culprits:
  - Mail/papers → one specific tray or folder
  - Charging cables → one spot (the hallway charging station)
  - Charlie's toys → one bin in the living room
  - Coats/bags → hooks by the door
  - Bookkeeping/office papers → one labeled folder or box in the office

**The 2-minute rule**
- If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it right now. Hang up the coat. Wipe the counter. Put the dish in the dishwasher. Throw away the wrapper.
- Most clutter is just 30-second tasks that were deferred.

**One load, one surface, one day**
- Every day, do one small thing: run a load of laundry, wipe one surface, clear one pile. Not a cleaning session — just one thing.
- Over a week, the apartment stays in shape without a big weekend cleanup.

**Dishwasher rhythm**
- Run it every evening. Empty it every morning (while coffee brews — it takes 3 min).
- Dishes never pile up in the sink.

**Office reset**
- The office is both your workspace and your bottleneck (bookkeeping papers lost in there).
- [ ] Block 2 hours one time to properly organize the office:
  - Sort all papers into 3 piles: action needed / file / trash
  - Set up a simple filing system: one folder per category (tax, receipts, contracts, personal)
  - Clear the desk to only: laptop, monitor, one notebook, pen, water bottle
- After the initial reset, the 2-minute rule keeps it clean.

**Frida's stuff separation**
- Already on your list. The fix: give Frida designated zones (shelves, bins, closet sections) where her stuff lives. Anything in her zone = her responsibility. Anything outside zones = gets put in her zone.
- [ ] Have the conversation with Frida — frame it as "I want us both to have clear spaces" not "clean up your stuff"

## Exercise

**The problem:** Training is "minimal" right now. Getting to a gym adds friction. Willpower-dependent exercise doesn't stick.

### Fixes

**Stack exercise onto things you already do**
- E-bike commute to preschool = 40 min of cycling on Charlie days (there and back). That's cardio handled automatically.
- Playing with Charlie at the playground = movement.
- Walking meetings (if any calls can be walking calls) = movement.

**Remove the "going to the gym" barrier**
- Option A: Home equipment. A pull-up bar (door frame), a kettlebell, and a resistance band cover 80% of what you need. Total cost: ~1,500 SEK. Zero commute time.
- Option B: Gym close to home (walking distance). If it's more than 10 min away, you won't go consistently.
- [ ] Decide: home equipment or nearby gym?
- [ ] If home: order pull-up bar + kettlebell + resistance band
- [ ] If gym: find one within 10 min walk and sign up

**The minimum viable workout**
- On days where a full session isn't happening, have a 15-min floor routine that requires nothing:
  - 3 rounds of: 15 pushups, 15 squats, 10 lunges each leg, 30s plank
  - Done. Better than nothing, and "nothing" is the real competition.

**Post-Vasaloppet plan**
- [ ] Define 3 sessions/week:
  - 2x strength (home or gym, 30-45 min)
  - 1x longer cardio (bike ride, run, swim)
  - Charlie-day e-bike commutes are bonus

---

## Errands & Admin

**The problem:** Small tasks pile up because they're annoying and easy to defer. Then they become big stressful tasks (see: bookkeeping).

### Fixes

**Batch errands into one trip/day per week**
- Pick one day (e.g., Thursday afternoon or Saturday morning) as "errand time."
- Pharmacy, post office, returns, hardware store — all in one loop.
- Rest of the week: if it's not urgent, it goes on the errand list for that day.
- [ ] Pick your weekly errand day

**Automate recurring admin**
- Autogiro (automatic payment) for every bill possible: rent, electricity, insurance, subscriptions, phone.
- [ ] Audit: which bills are NOT on autogiro yet? Set them up.
- Bookkeeping: 15 min every Sunday (weekly reset) prevents the quarterly panic. Photograph receipts immediately with phone → folder.
- [ ] Set up a "receipts" folder on phone (or use an app like Dext/Fortnox Kvitto)

**The "to handle" folder**
- One physical folder on your desk (or a tray) for any paper/letter/document that needs action.
- Process it during the Sunday admin batch or the weekly errand day. Everything else gets filed or trashed immediately.
- [ ] Set up the physical "to handle" folder

---

## Social Life & Friends

**The problem:** You want the apartment to be a gathering hub, but hangouts don't happen unless someone actively plans them.

### Fixes

**Lower the threshold**
- A "dinner party" sounds like work. "Come over for pasta and wine on Thursday" sounds easy. Keep it casual. Paper plates are fine.
- Text the group chat: "Pasta at ours Thursday 18:00, who's in?" — that's it.

**One recurring thing on the calendar**
- Monthly dinner/hang at your place. Pick a day (e.g., first Friday of each month). Put it on the calendar for the whole year. Invite the inner circle.
- Having it recurring means you never need to "find a time." The time exists. People show up or they don't.
- [ ] Pick the recurring date
- [ ] Send calendar invites to the inner circle for the next 3 months

**Non-Charlie evenings = social opportunity**
- On weeks without Charlie, evenings are free. This is when to say yes to plans, invite people over, or go out with Frida.
- [ ] Mark non-Charlie weeks in calendar as "social availability" so you're prompted to make plans

## Quick Wins (Do This Week)

The stuff that takes almost no effort but removes friction immediately:

- [ ] **Launch pad by the door** — tray or hook for keys/wallet/phone (15 min to set up, saves time forever)
- [ ] **Identical socks and underwear** — order online, throw out the mismatched ones (10 min)
- [ ] **Grocery delivery account** — sign up, place first order (20 min)
- [ ] **Dishwasher rhythm** — run every night, empty every morning (0 min to set up, just start doing it)
- [ ] **Clothes out the night before** — start tonight (30 seconds)
- [ ] **Charlie go-bag** — pack once, restock after each use (15 min)
- [ ] **"To handle" folder on desk** — one folder, label it (2 min)
- [ ] **Phone charging station outside bedroom** — move charger tonight (1 min)

## The Compound Effect

None of these changes is dramatic on its own. But stacked:

| Friction removed | Time saved per week |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Online groceries vs store trips | ~1.5 hours |
| E-bike commute (when active) | ~2.5 hours on Charlie weeks |
| No outfit decisions | ~30 min |
| Meal rotation (no dinner decision) | ~1 hour |
| Launch pad (no searching for things) | ~30 min |
| Night-before prep (no morning scramble) | ~1 hour |
| Batch errands vs scattered trips | ~1 hour |
| **Total** | **~8 hours/week** |

Eight hours. That's a full extra day every week for Frida, Charlie, friends, and building — reclaimed from friction.
