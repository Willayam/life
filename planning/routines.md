# Daily Routines & Friction Elimination

## Result
Every day runs on smooth defaults. Mornings launch me into focused work. Evenings wind me down into quality sleep. Transitions between modes are clean. Charlie weeks and non-Charlie weeks each have their own rhythm. The result: more hours for family, friends, and the work that matters — fewer hours lost to indecision, mess, and context switching.

## Purpose
Friction is invisible time theft. Every minute spent deciding what to do, looking for things, recovering from bad sleep, or context-switching is a minute stolen from Frida, Charlie, friends, and the projects that build freedom. Systems eliminate decisions. Defaults beat willpower.

## Friction Audit

These are the daily friction points diagnosed from brain dumps, weekly plans, and the current state of the system. Each one has a concrete fix.

| # | Friction | Time/Energy Cost | Fix | Status |
|---|---------|-----------------|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Preschool commute** — 45 min each way on Charlie days | ~3h/day on Charlie days | E-bike lease → 20 min each way + built-in exercise | [ ] Research in progress |
| 2 | **No morning launch sequence** — day starts reactive, checking phone/email | 30-60 min of drift | Fixed morning routine (below) — same every day | [ ] Implement |
| 3 | **Inconsistent sleep** — variable bedtime, screens, no wind-down | Cascading energy loss all next day | Evening shutdown ritual + Frida's sleep science | [ ] Implement |
| 4 | **No shutdown ritual** — work bleeds into evenings, can't be present | Frida/Charlie get distracted-William | Hard shutdown ritual at fixed time | [ ] Implement |
| 5 | **House clutter / office mess** — things pile up, can't find papers | Mental load + literal lost items (bookkeeping papers) | 10-min daily reset + weekend deep clean | [ ] Implement |
| 6 | **Inbox overload** — email is a swamp, important things get buried | Anxiety + missed follow-ups | Inbox zero batching (2x/day) + email classifier | [ ] Build classifier |
| 7 | **Admin/bookkeeping deferred** — always pushed to next week | Compounds into stressful catch-up sessions | Weekly admin block (fixed time, non-negotiable) | [ ] Schedule |
| 8 | **Decision fatigue on what to work on** — too many projects competing | 15-30 min of circling each morning | Previous evening: pick tomorrow's #1 result. Morning: just start. | [ ] Implement |
| 9 | **No Charlie-week vs free-week rhythm** — same expectations, different reality | Guilt + under-delivery on both sides | Two distinct day templates (below) | [ ] Implement |
| 10 | **Meals unplanned** — tracking calories but no prep system | Decision fatigue at every meal, unhealthy defaults | Meal prep Sunday + 5 rotation meals | [ ] Design |
| 11 | **Social life is wishful** — want apartment as hub but no cadence | Loneliness, relationships drift | Monthly dinner on calendar + spontaneous threshold lowered | [ ] Schedule first one |
| 12 | **No transition rituals** — jump between work/dad/partner modes | Residual attention from previous mode | 2-minute transition rituals (below) | [ ] Implement |

## The Daily Operating System

### Two Rhythms: Charlie Days vs Deep Work Days

The fundamental mistake is treating every day the same. Charlie days and non-Charlie days need completely different expectations. Accepting this eliminates guilt and creates realistic plans.

**Charlie Days** = presence + logistics + light work in margins
**Deep Work Days** = big blocks of focused building + social/relationship time in evenings

---

## Morning Routine (Non-Negotiable — ~45 min)

The same every day. No decisions. The sequence is designed to go from sleep to focused work with zero friction.

### Wake: 7:00 (7:30 latest)
_Consistent wake time is the #1 sleep lever — more important than bedtime._

1. **No phone for first 15 min** — phone stays in another room overnight (charging station in hallway/kitchen)
2. **Water + movement** (5 min) — glass of water, 20 pushups or a stretch sequence. Nothing fancy.
3. **Daylight exposure** (5 min) — open blinds, step onto balcony if possible. Resets circadian rhythm.
4. **Shower + dress** (15 min) — get fully dressed even on WFH days. Signals "on" mode.
5. **Coffee + today's #1 result** (10 min) — review what you picked last night. Don't re-decide. Just read it and start.
6. **First deep work block starts** (by 8:00 latest)

### Charlie Day Morning Variation
- Wake: 6:30 (need buffer for preschool prep)
- Steps 1-4 same but compressed
- Charlie breakfast + preschool departure by 7:45
- Deep work block starts after drop-off (~8:30 with e-bike, ~9:15 currently)

**What this eliminates:** Morning drift, phone rabbit holes, decision fatigue about what to do first.

---

## Deep Work Blocks

### The 90-Minute Block System

Work in 90-minute focused blocks with breaks. This matches natural ultradian rhythms and prevents the "work all day but accomplish nothing" trap.

**Non-Charlie Day:**
| Block | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Block 1 | 08:00-09:30 | #1 Result (Maxa / highest priority) |
| Break | 09:30-09:45 | Walk, snack, no screens |
| Block 2 | 09:45-11:15 | #1 Result continued or #2 priority |
| Break | 11:15-11:30 | Move, stretch |
| Block 3 | 11:30-13:00 | Consulting / client work (Inkarnate, Clarity) |
| Lunch | 13:00-13:45 | Eat away from desk. No working lunch. |
| Block 4 | 13:45-15:15 | Building / secondary projects |
| Admin batch | 15:15-16:00 | Email, messages, admin, bookkeeping bits |
| **Shutdown** | **16:00** | **Hard stop. Ritual below.** |

**Charlie Day (after drop-off):**
| Block | Time | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Block 1 | 09:15-10:45 | #1 Result only (protect this block fiercely) |
| Break | 10:45-11:00 | |
| Block 2 | 11:00-12:30 | Consulting / whatever is most urgent |
| Lunch | 12:30-13:00 | |
| Admin/email | 13:00-13:30 | Batch everything |
| **Pre-pickup** | **13:30** | Prep for Charlie, leave for pickup |
| Pickup → evening | 14:00+ | Charlie time. No work. Be present. |

**What this eliminates:** Context switching, all-day email checking, guilt about "not doing enough" on Charlie days. Charlie days get 2 blocks — that's the reality. Plan for it.

---

## Email & Communication Batching

**Rule: Email is checked twice per day. Not more.**

1. **11:00** — First email batch (after 2 deep work blocks are done)
2. **15:30** — Second email batch (during admin block)

**Between batches:** Notifications off. If something is truly urgent, people call.

**Inbox processing (each batch, 15-20 min max):**
- Reply if < 2 min
- Schedule/calendar if it's a meeting
- Add to weekly task list if it's a task
- Archive everything else

**What this eliminates:** The constant pull of "let me just check email" that fragments every work block.

---

## Shutdown Ritual (Non-Negotiable — 10 min)

This is the single most important routine. It draws a hard line between work and life. Without it, work bleeds into everything and you're never fully present with Frida, Charlie, or friends.

**When:** 16:00 on non-Charlie days. 13:30 on Charlie days (before pickup).

**The sequence:**
1. **Review today** (2 min) — What got done? Quick note in daily file.
2. **Pick tomorrow's #1 result** (2 min) — Write it down. This is decided NOW, not tomorrow morning.
3. **Check calendar for tomorrow** (1 min) — Any meetings, commitments, Charlie logistics?
4. **Capture loose threads** (2 min) — Anything floating in your head → write it down in daily note or weekly task list. Get it out of your brain.
5. **Close everything** (1 min) — All tabs, all apps. Laptop lid closed or put away.
6. **Say out loud or think: "Shutdown complete."** (This sounds silly. It works. It's a psychological signal.)

**After shutdown:**
- No work email
- No "just one quick thing"
- Phone goes to Do Not Disturb (allow calls from favorites only)

**What this eliminates:** Evening anxiety about unfinished work, distracted presence with family, the "always on" feeling.

---

## Evening Routine (Non-Negotiable — 45 min before bed)

### Target bedtime: 23:00 → Routine starts: 22:15

1. **22:15 — Kitchen reset** (10 min) — Dishes done, counters wiped, coffee prepped for morning. Waking up to a clean kitchen changes the entire morning.
2. **22:25 — Tomorrow's logistics check** (5 min) — Charlie stuff packed? Lunch prepped? Clothes out? Anything needed for tomorrow handled NOW. (If shutdown ritual was done properly, tomorrow's work plan is already set.)
3. **22:30 — Screens off** — Phone on charger in hallway (not bedroom). Laptop already away from shutdown ritual.
4. **22:30-23:00 — Wind down** — Options: read (physical book or Kindle), talk with Frida, stretch, listen to podcast/audiobook. No blue light screens.
5. **23:00 — Lights out**

### Frida's Sleep Science (Get Her Input On These)
- [ ] Ask Frida: What are your top 3 evidence-based tips for my sleep?
- Consistent wake time > consistent bedtime (already in morning routine)
- Cool bedroom (18-19°C ideal)
- No caffeine after 14:00
- Daylight exposure in first hour (already in morning routine)

**What this eliminates:** Doom scrolling, inconsistent sleep, waking up to yesterday's mess, morning scramble for logistics.

---

## Transition Rituals (2 Minutes Each)

These micro-rituals prevent "attention residue" — where your mind is still in the previous activity while your body is in the next one.

### Work → Charlie Pickup
- Close laptop
- 3 deep breaths
- Think of one thing you want to do with Charlie today
- Leave phone in bag during pickup (be the dad who's looking at his kid, not his phone)

### Charlie Bedtime → Frida Time
- After Charlie is down, take 2 min before going to Frida
- Quick body scan: Am I tense? Tired? What energy am I bringing?
- Intention: Be with her, not next to her

### Waking Up → Morning Routine
- Feet on floor = routine starts. No negotiation.
- Phone is in another room so there's nothing to check

### Deep Work Block → Break
- Stand up, walk to window or another room
- 10 deep breaths or quick stretch
- Refill water
- Do NOT check phone/email during breaks between deep work blocks

---

## Weekly Maintenance Blocks

Some friction is caused by deferred maintenance. These are fixed weekly time blocks that prevent pile-up.

### Sunday: Weekly Reset (1.5 hours)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 30 min | **Meal planning + grocery order** — Pick 5 dinners for the week. Order groceries online for delivery. No daily "what's for dinner?" decisions. |
| 15 min | **Home scan** — Walk through apartment. What needs attention? Quick tidying. Anything broken/out of place? |
| 15 min | **Calendar review** — Look at the week ahead. Charlie schedule, meetings, deadlines. Identify the 3 results for the week. |
| 15 min | **Admin/finance batch** — Quick bookkeeping entries, bills, receipts. Small weekly doses prevent the quarterly panic. |
| 15 min | **Social planning** — Anyone you want to see this week? Send one text/invite. Monthly dinner on calendar? |

### Wednesday: Mid-Week Check (15 min)
- Quick scan: Am I on track for the week's top 3?
- Anything need to be adjusted or cut?
- Any follow-ups due?

---

## 10-Minute Daily Reset

Every day, either as part of the shutdown ritual or evening routine, do a quick physical space reset:

- Desk cleared (everything has a home)
- Dishes done (or in dishwasher running)
- Charlie's stuff put away (if Charlie day)
- Clothes not on floor
- One surface cleaned that's been bugging you

**Rule:** If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. Don't add it to a list.

This isn't about having a perfect home. It's about never having the "house is a mess" thought drain your energy. Small daily resets prevent weekend-long cleaning marathons.

---

## Meal Friction Elimination

You already track calories in MacroFactor. The friction isn't tracking — it's deciding and preparing.

### The 5 Rotation System
Pick 5 go-to meals for each category. Rotate. Stop deciding.

**Breakfasts (pick 2-3, rotate):**
- [ ] Define your rotation (e.g., overnight oats, eggs + toast, smoothie, yogurt bowl)

**Lunches (pick 3, rotate):**
- [ ] Define your rotation (e.g., chicken + rice + veg, wraps, big salad, leftovers)

**Dinners (plan weekly on Sunday):**
- [ ] Pick from a master list of 10-15 meals you and Frida both enjoy
- [ ] Grocery delivery — order everything Sunday, delivered Monday

**Snacks (always stocked):**
- [ ] Define your always-have-at-home list (e.g., Greek yogurt, nuts, fruit, protein bars)

### Sunday Meal Prep (~1 hour)
- Cook 2 proteins (chicken, ground turkey, etc.)
- Prep 2 carb bases (rice, potatoes, pasta)
- Wash and chop vegetables
- This covers lunches and makes dinners faster all week

**What this eliminates:** The daily "what should I eat?" decision, last-minute unhealthy choices, grocery store trips during the week.

---

## The Phone Problem

Your phone is both your most useful tool and your biggest friction source. Rules:

1. **Phone charges outside the bedroom overnight** — No exceptions
2. **No phone first 15 min after waking** — Morning routine doesn't need it
3. **Do Not Disturb 22:00-07:30** — Allow calls from favorites only
4. **Delete or hide social media from home screen** — Use it intentionally on desktop, not reflexively on phone
5. **Notification audit** — Turn off all notifications except: calls, messages from Frida/family, calendar reminders. Everything else is batched.

---

## Implementation Plan

Don't try to do all of this at once. That's how routines fail. Stack one habit at a time.

### Week 1: The Anchors
- [ ] Set consistent wake time (7:00)
- [ ] Phone out of bedroom at night
- [ ] Implement shutdown ritual at 16:00
- [ ] Pick tomorrow's #1 result every evening

### Week 2: Morning + Evening
- [ ] Full morning routine in place
- [ ] Evening routine (kitchen reset, screens off 22:30)
- [ ] Email batching — 2x/day only

### Week 3: Weekly Systems
- [ ] Sunday weekly reset (meal plan, admin, social, calendar)
- [ ] 10-min daily apartment reset
- [ ] Wednesday mid-week check

### Week 4: Optimize
- [ ] Meal rotation defined and grocery system running
- [ ] Charlie-day vs deep-work-day blocks refined based on 3 weeks of data
- [ ] Ask Frida for sleep audit
- [ ] E-bike researched and decision made

## Measuring Success

This isn't about perfect execution. It's about trend. Weekly review should note:

- **Sleep quality (1-10)** — trending up?
- **Energy (1-10)** — trending up?
- **Deep work blocks completed** — how many of the planned blocks actually happened?
- **Shutdown on time?** — Y/N
- **Present with family?** — Frida and Charlie connection scores trending up?
- **Social time this week?** — Did I see friends?
- **House state** — Clean enough to have someone over spontaneously?

The goal isn't "did I follow every routine perfectly?" The goal is: **Am I spending more time on what matters and less time on what doesn't?**
