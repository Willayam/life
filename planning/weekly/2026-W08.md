# Week 8, 2026 (Feb 17-23)

**Theme: Ship what matters. Recover. Race.**

This is a split week: productive Mon-Thu, then Vasaloppet mode Fri-Sun. Charlie is here Wed-Thu. You have a cold — recovery is the background priority all week.

## RPM Check-In

### Top 3 Results This Week

1. **Result:** Maxa app fully tested and ready for TestFlight submission
   - **Purpose:** This is the #1 bet. Every week it's not launched is a week of zero revenue. Getting it into TestFlight means real users can test it and you're one step from the App Store.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Test every flow in the app end-to-end (Mon-Wed)
     - [ ] Fix any blockers found during testing
     - [ ] Get the build into TestFlight by Wednesday evening
     - [ ] Finalize question extraction if not done

2. **Result:** Vasaloppet completed — healthy, prepared, and enjoying it
   - **Purpose:** Physical challenge, adventure, fun. Proves to yourself you can do hard things. Recharges the batteries.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Recovery protocol all week (sleep, hydration, zinc, no alcohol)
     - [ ] Make protein/chocolate bars (Friday evening or Saturday morning)
     - [ ] Pack everything by Friday night — use [checklist](../vasaloppet-2026.md)
     - [ ] Download playlist (4-6 hours, paced by race segments)
     - [ ] Leave Saturday, race Sunday

3. **Result:** Host two great social events (Tue Fettis-OS, Thu dinner) — be present and connected
   - **Purpose:** This is what the freedom is FOR. Friends, community, being the host. Frida and I building the life we want.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Tue: Buy samla + return Frida's cashmere pants (bike errand)
     - [ ] Tue: Host Fettis-OS 18:00-21:00 (18 guests, semlor + curling)
     - [ ] Thu: Confirm dinner guests, plan easy healthy group meal
     - [ ] Thu: Cook and host dinner (4-6 people)

**Event:** Semla tasting + Olympic curling (Sweden vs Norway)
**Guests:** 18 confirmed
**Location:** Your place, Grindsgatan 43 (5.5 floors up)

**To-do:**

- [ ] Return Frida's cashmere pants (while out on bike)
- [ ] Set up TV/screen for curling (starts 19:05)
- [ ] Plates, napkins, coffee/tea for semla tasting
- [ ] Tasting scorecards? (fun touch — rate each semla 1-10)
- [ ] Clean up apartment before guests arrive
- [ ] Drinks: coffee, tea, maybe some glögg or other?

### Thursday — Dinner with Friends (4-6 people)
**To-do:**
- [ ] Confirm who's coming (text today/tomorrow)
- [ ] Plan easy, healthy group meal (suggestions below)
- [ ] Buy ingredients Wed or Thu morning

**Dinner ideas (easy for 4-6, healthy, crowd-pleasing):**
1. **Big sheet-pan chicken + roasted vegetables + couscous** — minimal prep, throw in oven, done
2. **Slow-cooker chili or stew** — prep in morning, ready by evening. Serve with bread + salad
3. **Salmon with roasted sweet potatoes + green salad** — 30 min, impressive, healthy
4. **Taco night** — everyone assembles their own. Easy, fun, scales perfectly. Use lean ground turkey or chicken.

_Note: Thursday is also a carb-loading day for Vasaloppet — choose something carb-rich!_
