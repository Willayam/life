## RPM Check-In

### Top 3 Results This Week

1. **Result:** Bookkeeping completed for rest of year + salary payout cash secured

     - [ ] Find all office papers for bookkeeping
     - [ ] Get bookkeeping done for everything except the 55K expense (defer until after salary payout)
     - [ ] Calculate: ~100K in account - 13-15K booked expenses - salary payout = remaining
     - [ ] Move the difference into savings → Tesla stock
     - [ ] Confirm salary payout date and amount with accountant

2. **Result:** ✅ Clarity.video proposal sent with new risk-based pricing

     - [x] Draft new proposal: risk-based, 50% profit share, $1,000 floor
     - [x] Frame it around maxing out design — glassmorphism, super clean UX
     - [x] Acknowledge this is more work than last summer, price accordingly
     - [x] Send proposal

3. **Result:** Maxa on Play Store for Olivia to test
   - **Purpose:** Real user testing unblocks launch. Olivia testing = first external feedback loop. Ship > perfect.

     - [ ] Submit to Play Store
     - [ ] Send to Olivia for testing once live

## Priority Stack (Honest Ordering)

_If I can only do 3 things this week, it's these:_

1. **Bookkeeping + salary optimization** — time-sensitive, protects parental leave
2. **Clarity proposal** — revenue opportunity, concrete deliverable
3. **Play Store submission** — moves Maxa toward real users

_Everything else is important but not urgent. Don't let the shiny building tasks (claymorphism, email classifier, Framer replication) eat the days before these three are done._

## Notes

_Space for daily notes, blockers, or things that come up during the week_

### 2026-02-13 Brain Dump
- Big batch of items captured. Many building/learning tasks competing with revenue-critical tasks.
- Bookkeeping: ~100K in account, 13-15K booked, 55K big expense from last year (defer). Need to protect salary payout cash.
- Want to invest surplus in Tesla stock.
- Clarity: new approach — take the risk, 50% profit, $1,000 floor. More work than last summer. Max out design.
- Stripe cost separation: Marcus costs vs app/company costs — need proper reporting.
- House is messy. Need to separate stuff so Frida handles her own packing.
- Want to suggest Jessica swap a weekend day for custody.
