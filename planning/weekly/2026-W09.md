## RPM Check-In

### Top 3 Results This Week

1. **Result:** Maxa submitted to the App Store with all required Apple documents
   - **Purpose:** This is the #1 bet. Every day not in the store is a day of zero revenue. The app is close — push it over the finish line.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Prepare and submit all required Apple documentation
     - [ ] Complete App Store submission requirements (screenshots, description, metadata)
     - [ ] Submit app for App Store review
     - [ ] Follow up with Olivia on TestFlight testing if not done

2. **Result:** Clarity partnership agreement finalized and signed with proper contract protections
   - **Purpose:** Real revenue ($1K/month floor + upside) with a partner who has distribution. But protect your downside — you're investing time upfront that has long-term value.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Research contract structures for profit-share tech partnerships (vesting of effort, IP protection, termination clauses)
     - [ ] Revise proposal into a formal, signable agreement with: minimum term, termination protection, IP provisions, buyout clause for early exit
     - [ ] Send revised agreement to Todd/Mikey before Thursday
     - [ ] Thu Feb 26 4:30 PM CET — Finalize and sign call with Todd (⚠️ may conflict with mountain trip — plan ahead)
     - [ ] Prepare Business Mastery booth vision to discuss on the call

3. **Result:** Expa fully handed off — final deliverable sent, no more open threads
   - **Purpose:** Stop the energy drain. Clean exit means clean mind. This has been dragging since October.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Complete and send final deliverable/document to Expa
     - [ ] Confirm Erik Karlsson handoff is complete
     - [ ] Answer Catrine's 3 outstanding questions (mobile mandatory, email checking, logo visibility) or route to Erik
     - [ ] Send a clear "I'm done" message so there's no ambiguity

## Time Design

_Post-Vasaloppet week. Charlie arrives Wed. Front-load all deep work Mon-Tue._

| Day | Charlie? | Plan |
|-----|----------|------|
| Mon | No | **Recovery day + logistics.** Light work. Get spare key made. Book mountain train tickets. Start Clarity contract research. Expa final deliverable. |
| Tue | No | **Deep work day — most important day of the week.** AM: Maxa App Store submission + Apple docs. PM: Finalize Clarity agreement draft. Inkarnate design prep (time-boxed 2h). Send Expa closeout. |
| Wed | Yes | **Travel to mountains with Charlie.** Morning: send Clarity agreement to Todd. Then travel. Light work only if needed. |
| Thu | Yes | **Mountains with Charlie.** 4:30 PM CET: Clarity call with Todd (take from phone/laptop). Otherwise: be present with Charlie. |
| Fri | Yes | **Cleaning comes — need key solution sorted.** Charlie day. Light admin only. |
| Sat | Yes | Charlie day. No work. Be present. |
| Sun | Yes | Charlie day. No work. Weekly review. |

## Critical Conflicts & Decisions

1. **Thu Clarity call vs mountains:** The call is 4:30 PM CET. If you're in the mountains, you'll need cell service and 30-60 min of quiet. Plan for this — scope out a café or lodge with WiFi. Or: go to mountains Wed, come back Thu morning, take call from home.
2. **Tuesday is make-or-break:** Almost everything important needs to happen or be queued up by end of Tuesday. After that, you're in Charlie/mountain mode.
3. **Key must be sorted by Friday morning.** Monday is the day for this.
