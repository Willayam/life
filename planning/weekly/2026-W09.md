## RPM Check-In

### Top 3 Results This Week

1. **Result:** Maxa submitted to the App Store with all required Apple documents
   - **Purpose:** This is the #1 bet. Every day not in the store is a day of zero revenue. The app is close — push it over the finish line.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Prepare and submit all required Apple documentation
     - [ ] Complete App Store submission requirements (screenshots, description, metadata)
     - [ ] Submit app for App Store review
     - [ ] Follow up with Olivia on TestFlight testing if not done

2. **Result:** Clarity partnership agreement finalized and signed with proper contract protections
   - **Purpose:** Real revenue ($1K/month floor + upside) with a partner who has distribution. But protect your downside — you're investing time upfront that has long-term value.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Research contract structures for profit-share tech partnerships (vesting of effort, IP protection, termination clauses)
     - [ ] Revise proposal into a formal, signable agreement with: minimum term, termination protection, IP provisions, buyout clause for early exit
     - [ ] Send revised agreement to Todd/Mikey before Thursday
     - [ ] Thu Feb 26 4:30 PM CET — Finalize and sign call with Todd (⚠️ may conflict with mountain trip — plan ahead)
     - [ ] Prepare Business Mastery booth vision to discuss on the call

3. **Result:** Expa fully handed off — final deliverable sent, no more open threads
   - **Purpose:** Stop the energy drain. Clean exit means clean mind. This has been dragging since October.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Complete and send final deliverable/document to Expa
     - [ ] Confirm Erik Karlsson handoff is complete
     - [ ] Answer Catrine's 3 outstanding questions (mobile mandatory, email checking, logo visibility) or route to Erik
     - [ ] Send a clear "I'm done" message so there's no ambiguity

### 15:00–17:30 — Maxa: Launch Prep
**Deliverable:** 4 practice tests fully approved and working on both web and app. Layout improvements done. Closer to App Store submission.

## Thursday Feb 26 — Mountains with Charlie

All day: Be present with Charlie.

### 16:30–17:30 — Clarity Call with Todd
- Find WiFi + quiet spot (lodge/café)
- Discuss partnership agreement details
- Discuss booth strategy for Business Mastery

---

## Critical Conflicts & Decisions

1. **Thu Clarity call vs mountains:** Call is 16:30. Need WiFi + 30-60 min quiet. Scout a spot at Harsa.
2. **Tue afternoon is the Inkarnate block.** 3.5 hours — don't let it bleed. Rough prototype > perfect one.
3. **Wed is tight.** Finance → overflow → Inkarnate meeting → Charlie → train. Stay disciplined on transitions.
