## RPM Check-In

### Top 3 Results This Week

1. **Result:** Maxa submitted to the App Store with all required Apple documents
   - **Purpose:** This is the #1 bet. Every day not in the store is a day of zero revenue. The app is close — push it over the finish line.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Prepare and submit all required Apple documentation
     - [ ] Complete App Store submission requirements (screenshots, description, metadata)
     - [ ] Submit app for App Store review
     - [ ] Follow up with Olivia on TestFlight testing if not done

2. **Result:** Clarity partnership agreement finalized and signed with proper contract protections
   - **Purpose:** Real revenue ($1K/month floor + upside) with a partner who has distribution. But protect your downside — you're investing time upfront that has long-term value.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Research contract structures for profit-share tech partnerships (vesting of effort, IP protection, termination clauses)
     - [ ] Revise proposal into a formal, signable agreement with: minimum term, termination protection, IP provisions, buyout clause for early exit
     - [ ] Send revised agreement to Todd/Mikey before Thursday
     - [ ] Thu Feb 26 4:30 PM CET — Finalize and sign call with Todd (⚠️ may conflict with mountain trip — plan ahead)
     - [ ] Prepare Business Mastery booth vision to discuss on the call

3. **Result:** Expa fully handed off — final deliverable sent, no more open threads
   - **Purpose:** Stop the energy drain. Clean exit means clean mind. This has been dragging since October.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Complete and send final deliverable/document to Expa
     - [ ] Confirm Erik Karlsson handoff is complete
     - [ ] Answer Catrine's 3 outstanding questions (mobile mandatory, email checking, logo visibility) or route to Erik
     - [ ] Send a clear "I'm done" message so there's no ambiguity

## Tuesday Feb 25 — Overview

### First thing: Follow up with cleaning company if no reply yet

### Morning (09:00–13:00): Expa Engineering
- Migrate Buildship integration to Vaylo CLI tool
- Update components (expand/collapse)
- Write handoff documentation
- Test that everything works end-to-end

### Afternoon (14:00–16:00): Expa Closeout + Clarity Polish
- Answer Catrine's 3 questions (or route to Erik)
- Send "I'm done" closeout message
- Polish and send Clarity agreement if not sent Monday
- Prep Business Mastery booth vision document

### Late Afternoon (16:00–17:30): Maxa Metadata
- App Store screenshots
- App description and keywords
- Prepare submission metadata so it's ready to go once Apple docs clear

### Evening: Confirm salary payout went through (Feb 25)

---

## Wednesday Feb 26 — Overview

### Morning before travel:
- [ ] Final review and send Clarity agreement (if not already sent)
- [ ] Send Expa closeout message (if not already sent)
- [ ] **Follow up on Apple Developer enrollment** — check if docs were accepted or if they need anything else (case 20000105358621)
- [ ] Travel to mountains with Charlie

### 4:30 PM CET Thursday — Clarity call with Todd
- Find a lodge/café with WiFi
- Have agreement ready to discuss and sign
- Discuss booth strategy for Business Mastery

---

## Critical Conflicts & Decisions

1. **Thu Clarity call vs mountains:** Call is 4:30 PM CET. Need WiFi + 30-60 min quiet. Scout a lodge or café. Alternative: travel Wed, return Thu morning.
2. **Mon-Tue are everything:** After Tuesday, you're in Charlie/mountain mode. Ship it or it waits a week.
3. ~~Key must be sorted by Friday morning.~~ Cleaning rebooked — awaiting confirmation for Wed or next Mon.
4. **Don't let Inkarnate eat the day.** It's time-boxed 13:00–16:30. Stop at 16:30 even if not perfect — a rough prototype they can react to is better than a perfect one delivered late.
