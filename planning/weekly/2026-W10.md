## RPM Check-In

### Top 3 Results This Week

1. **Result:** Maxa submitted to App Store review
   - **Purpose:** This has been "almost done" for three weeks. Every day not in the store is a day of zero revenue. Ship it. No more prep — submit.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Final QA pass on the 4 practice tests (web + app)
     - [ ] Complete App Store metadata (screenshots, description, keywords)
     - [ ] Submit to App Store review
     - [ ] Follow up with Olivia on TestFlight testing status
     - [ ] Follow up with Pietro on mascot status

2. **Result:** Clarity contract updated, signed, and first invoice sent
   - **Purpose:** $1K/month floor + upside. Real revenue with distribution. But it needs a proper contract — not a handshake. Get it done and get paid.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Update contract with termination protection, IP clauses, vesting of effort
     - [ ] Send updated contract to Todd/Mikey
     - [ ] Follow up on signing
     - [ ] Send first $1K invoice once signed
     - [ ] Get full codebase access + Stripe dashboard

3. **Result:** Inkarnate nav update shipped and March invoice sent
   - **Purpose:** This is the 90K/month lifeline. Deliver great work, stay visible, and get paid on time.
   - **Massive action:**
     - [ ] Complete navigation update (demo-ready branch/PR)
     - [ ] Send March invoice to Inkarnate
     - [ ] Weekly check-in with Inkarnate team
     - [ ] Time-box consulting — don't let it eat the whole week
